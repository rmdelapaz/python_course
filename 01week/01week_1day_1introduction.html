            <h2>Welcome to Web Development</h2>
            <p>Imagine you're building a house. You need a foundation, walls, plumbing, electrical wiring, and interior design to make it functional and beautiful. Web development is remarkably similar! We'll be building digital structures that require both solid foundations (backend) and beautiful interiors (frontend).</p>
            
            <p>As new Python developers, you're embarking on a journey that will transform you from visitors of the web to creators of the web. Whether you're building a personal blog, an e-commerce platform, or the next revolutionary social application, the principles we'll learn apply universally.</p>
            
            <p>Think of the web as a vast ecosystem where your applications will live and interact with users and other systems. You'll learn not just to build applications, but to understand how they fit into this broader ecosystem.</p>
            
            <h3>Learning Path Ahead</h3>
            <p>Our journey will combine theory with hands-on practice. In each session, we'll:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explore key concepts with clear explanations and relatable analogies</li>
                <li>See real-world examples of these concepts in action</li>
                <li>Practice implementing what we've learned with guided exercises</li>
                <li>Build on previous knowledge to create increasingly complex applications</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>By the end of this course, you'll have the skills to build, deploy, and maintain full-stack web applications using Python and modern development tools.</p>

            <h2>The Web as an Ecosystem</h2>
            
            <p>The web isn't just a collection of pages - it's a living, breathing ecosystem of interconnected services, applications, and resources. Think of it as a vast digital city where information flows through carefully designed pathways.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Components of the Web</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clients</strong>: Devices and software that request information (browsers, mobile apps)</li>
                <li><strong>Servers</strong>: Computers that store and deliver content upon request</li>
                <li><strong>Databases</strong>: Structured storage systems for application data</li>
                <li><strong>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)</strong>: Rules that allow different software to communicate</li>
                <li><strong>Protocols</strong>: Standardized methods for communication (HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Consider how a restaurant works: customers (clients) order food, servers take requests to the kitchen (backend servers), chefs prepare the meal using ingredients from the pantry (database), and finally, the prepared meal returns to the customer. The web works in a remarkably similar fashion!</p>
            
            <h3>The Evolution of the Web</h3>
            <p>The web has evolved dramatically since its inception:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Web 1.0</strong>: Static pages with limited interaction (early 1990s to early 2000s)</li>
                <li><strong>Web 2.0</strong>: Interactive applications, user-generated content, social media (mid-2000s to present)</li>
                <li><strong>Web 3.0</strong>: Emerging paradigm focusing on decentralization, AI integration, and semantic understanding</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>As web developers, we build on decades of evolution while embracing new technologies and approaches.</p>

            <h2>The Client-Server Model</h2>
            
            <p>At its core, the web operates on a client-server model. This fundamental architecture pattern defines how web applications function.</p>
            
            <h3>What is a Client?</h3>
            <p>A client is any device or software that requests and displays web content. Common examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)</li>
                <li>Mobile applications</li>
                <li>IoT devices</li>
                <li>Other web services or applications</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Think of clients as customers at a restaurant. They place orders (requests) and receive food (data) in return.</p>
            
            <h3>What is a Server?</h3>
            <p>A server is a computer program or device that processes requests and delivers data to clients. Servers handle various responsibilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Storing and retrieving data</li>
                <li>Processing business logic</li>
                <li>Authenticating users</li>
                <li>Serving files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)</li>
                <li>Connecting to databases and other services</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Continuing our restaurant analogy, servers are like the kitchen staff who receive orders, prepare food, and ensure it's delivered to the right customer.</p>
            
            <h3>How They Interact</h3>
            <p>The interaction between clients and servers follows a simple pattern:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The client sends a request to a server</li>
                <li>The server processes the request</li>
                <li>The server returns a response to the client</li>
                <li>The client processes and displays the response</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This pattern happens countless times as you browse the web, often in fractions of a second.</p>
            
            <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
            <p>Let's trace what happens when you visit a website like wikipedia.org:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You type "wikipedia.org" in your browser (the client)</li>
                <li>Your browser sends a request to Wikipedia's servers</li>
                <li>The servers process the request, retrieving the necessary data from databases</li>
                <li>The servers generate an HTML page and send it back to your browser</li>
                <li>Your browser renders the HTML, making additional requests for CSS, JavaScript, and images</li>
                <li>The completed page appears on your screen</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>All of this typically happens in less than a second, demonstrating the remarkable efficiency of modern web infrastructure.</p>
