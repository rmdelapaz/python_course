        <section class="intro">
            <h3>Understanding Version Control</h3>
            <p>Version control is to code what save points are to video games - a safety net that allows you to explore freely knowing you can always return to a previous state. It's the technological equivalent of a time machine for your projects.</p>
            
            <p>At its core, version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. Imagine you're writing a novel and want to try a different ending - version control lets you create that alternate ending while preserving your original work.</p>
            
            <p>In the world of software development, version control is not a luxury but a necessity, much like how a pilot needs instruments to fly safely through clouds.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="why-use">
            <h3>Why Use Version Control?</h3>
            <p>Consider this scenario: You're working on a web application, and it's functioning perfectly. You decide to add a new feature, but after making numerous changes across multiple files, the application crashes. Without version control, you'd need to remember every change you made and manually revert them - like trying to un-bake a cake.</p>
            
            <p>Version control systems provide:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>History tracking:</strong> Like a detailed journal of your project, recording who changed what, when, and why</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration capabilities:</strong> Enabling multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other's work</li>
                <li><strong>Backup mechanism:</strong> Protecting your code from accidental deletion or computer failure</li>
                <li><strong>Experimentation freedom:</strong> Allowing you to try new approaches without fear of breaking existing functionality</li>
                <li><strong>Project management insights:</strong> Providing visibility into who is working on what and how the project is evolving</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="version-control-types">
            <h3>Types of Version Control Systems</h3>
            
            <h4>Local Version Control Systems</h4>
            <p>The simplest form of version control is manual - copying your project folder and renaming it (project_v1, project_v2, etc.). This is like taking photographs of your whiteboard after each meeting. It's better than nothing, but it's error-prone and inefficient.</p>
            
            <p>Early automated systems like RCS (Revision Control System) store patch sets (differences between files) in a special format on disk. Think of it as saving only the edits to a document rather than full copies, similar to how a teacher might mark up a student's paper rather than rewriting it entirely.</p>
            
            <h4>Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)</h4>
            <p>Systems like SVN (Subversion) and CVS (Concurrent Versions System) use a central server that contains all versioned files. This is like a library where books (code) must be checked out before modifications and returned afterward.</p>
            
            <p>The advantages include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Everyone knows what others are doing on the project</li>
                <li>Administrators have control over who can do what</li>
                <li>Easier to manage than local VCS</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The downsides include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Single point of failure - if the server goes down, no one can collaborate or save changes</li>
                <li>If the central database becomes corrupted without backups, you lose everything except local copies</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)</h4>
            <p>Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar are distributed systems where clients fully mirror the repository, including its history. This is like everyone having their own complete library rather than a single central one.</p>
            
            <p>The advantages include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If a server dies, any client repository can be copied back to the server to restore it</li>
                <li>Multiple backups exist by default</li>
                <li>Enables various collaborative workflows that aren't possible with centralized systems</li>
                <li>Work can continue even without internet connection to a central server</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Today, Git has become the de facto standard for version control due to its speed, distributed nature, and the popularity of hosting services like GitHub.</p>

            <h3>Git Fundamentals</h3>
            
            <h4>The Three States of Git</h4>
            <p>In Git, your files exist in three main states, similar to the states of matter (solid, liquid, gas):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modified:</strong> You've changed the file, but haven't committed it to your database yet. Like ingredients that have been prepared but not yet cooked.</li>
                <li><strong>Staged:</strong> You've marked a modified file to go into your next commit. Think of this as placing ingredients into a cooking pot, ready to be turned into a meal.</li>
                <li><strong>Committed:</strong> The data is safely stored in your local database. This is the finished meal, documented in your recipe book.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Basic Git Terminology</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Repository (Repo):</strong> A collection of files and their complete history. Think of it as a project's timeline with all its changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Commit:</strong> A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time, like a photograph preserving a moment.</li>
                <li><strong>Branch:</strong> An independent line of development, like a parallel universe where you can experiment without affecting the main reality.</li>
                <li><strong>Merge:</strong> The act of integrating changes from one branch into another, like weaving two separate threads into a single rope.</li>
                <li><strong>Clone:</strong> Creating a copy of an existing repository, similar to photocopying a book.</li>
                <li><strong>Push:</strong> Uploading local repository content to a remote repository, like publishing your work for others to see.</li>
                <li><strong>Pull:</strong> Downloading and integrating remote changes, like updating your textbook with the latest edition's content.</li>
                <li><strong>Fetch:</strong> Downloading remote content without integrating it, like receiving a document but not yet reading it.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="basic-git-commands">
            <h3>Essential Git Commands</h3>
            
            <h4>Setting Up a Repository</h4>
            <div class="code-example">
                <code>git init</code>
                <p>Creates a new Git repository. This is like establishing a new timeline for your project. It adds a hidden .git folder that stores all the version history data.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h4>Checking Status</h4>
            <div class="code-example">
                <code>git status</code>
                <p>Shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It tells you which changes are tracked, untracked, modified, or staged. This is like checking a dashboard to see where everything stands.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h4>Adding Files to Staging</h4>
            <div class="code-example">
                <code>git add filename.py</code>
                <p>Adds a specific file to the staging area, preparing it for commit.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <code>git add .</code>
                <p>Adds all changed files in the current directory to staging. Use with caution - you might include files you didn't mean to commit!</p>
            </div>
            
            <h4>Committing Changes</h4>
            <div class="code-example">
                <code>git commit -m "Add login functionality"</code>
                <p>Creates a new commit with all staged changes. The message should clearly describe what changed and why. Think of each commit as signing your name to a specific set of changes.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h4>Viewing History</h4>
            <div class="code-example">
                <code>git log</code>
                <p>Shows the commit history, like reading a project diary with entries for each significant change.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <code>git log --oneline</code>
                <p>Shows a condensed history with one line per commit - useful for getting a quick overview.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>A Practical Git Workflow</h3>
            
            <p>Let's walk through a real-world example of using Git in a Python web project:</p>
            
            <h4>Scenario: Adding a New User Registration Feature</h4>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Start by creating a repository for your project:
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>mkdir my_flask_app</code>
                        <code>cd my_flask_app</code>
                        <code>git init</code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                
                <li>Create your initial project files and make your first commit:
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>touch app.py requirements.txt</code>
                        <code># Edit these files with your code editor</code>
                        <code>git add .</code>
                        <code>git commit -m "Initial project setup"</code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                
                <li>Add some basic Flask application code to app.py:
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('home.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
                        </code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                
                <li>Create a templates directory and add a home.html file:
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>mkdir templates</code>
                        <code>touch templates/home.html</code>
                    </div>
                    <p>Add some HTML to the home.html file:</p>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Flask App&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Flask App&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
                        </code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                
                <li>Stage and commit these changes:
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>git add .</code>
                        <code>git commit -m "Add basic Flask application structure"</code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                
                <li>Check your commit history:
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>git log --oneline</code>
                    </div>
                    <p>You should see something like:</p>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>
a1b2c3d Add basic Flask application structure
e5f6g7h Initial project setup
                        </code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                
                <li>Now, let's add the user registration functionality:
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code># Modify app.py to add registration route</code>
                    </div>
                    <p>Updated app.py:</p>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

# Simple in-memory user storage (would use a database in production)
users = []

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('home.html')

@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def register():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']  # Would hash this in production
        users.append({'username': username, 'password': password})
        return redirect(url_for('home'))
    return render_template('register.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
                        </code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                
                <li>Create a register.html template:
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>touch templates/register.html</code>
                    </div>
                    <p>Add form HTML:</p>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Register - My Flask App&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Register New Account&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;form method="POST"&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;Username:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type="text" name="username" required&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;Password:&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;input type="password" name="password" required&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Register&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;a href="/"&gt;Back to Home&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
                        </code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                
                <li>Update home.html to include a link to the registration page:
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Flask App&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Flask App&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;a href="/register"&gt;Register New Account&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
                        </code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                
                <li>Check what files have changed:
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>git status</code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                
                <li>Commit the new feature:
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>git add .</code>
                        <code>git commit -m "Add user registration functionality"</code>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Now, if something goes wrong with your registration feature, you can always go back to the previous working state using git commands.</p>

        <section class="best-practices">
            <h3>Version Control Best Practices</h3>
            
            <h4>Commit Messages</h4>
            <p>Good commit messages are like well-written chapter titles in a book - they help readers understand what's inside without having to read the whole thing.</p>
            
            <p>Follow these guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")</li>
                <li>Be specific but concise (aim for under 50 characters)</li>
                <li>Start with a verb (Fix, Add, Update, Remove, Refactor, etc.)</li>
                <li>Reference issue numbers if applicable ("Fix login bug #123")</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Bad:</strong> <code>git commit -m "changes"</code></p>
            <p><strong>Good:</strong> <code>git commit -m "Add password reset functionality"</code></p>
            
            <h4>Commit Frequency</h4>
            <p>Commit frequency is like deciding when to save your progress in a video game:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Commit when you complete a logical unit of work</li>
                <li>Don't wait too long between commits - smaller commits are easier to understand and roll back if needed</li>
                <li>Ensure the code compiles and passes basic tests before committing</li>
                <li>Think of each commit as a "savepoint" you might need to return to</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Ignoring Files</h4>
            <p>Not all files should be tracked in version control. Create a .gitignore file to exclude:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generated files (compiled code, built assets)</li>

            <h3>Common Version Control Scenarios</h3>
            
            <h4>Scenario 1: Undoing Changes</h4>
            <p>You've made changes to a file but realize they're incorrect and want to revert to the last committed version:</p>
            <div class="code-example">
                <code>git checkout -- filename.py</code>
            </div>
            <p>Think of this as using a time machine to restore a file to its previous state.</p>
            
            <h4>Scenario 2: Viewing Differences</h4>
            <p>You want to see what's changed since your last commit:</p>
            <div class="code-example">
                <code>git diff</code>
            </div>
            <p>This is like using a "spot the difference" tool between two versions of your code.</p>
            
            <h4>Scenario 3: Fixing the Last Commit</h4>
            <p>You made a commit but forgot to include a file or made a typo in the commit message:</p>
            <div class="code-example">
                <code>git add forgotten_file.py</code>
                <code>git commit --amend -m "Correct commit message"</code>
            </div>
            <p>This is like going back to edit the last entry in your journal.</p>
            
            <h4>Scenario 4: Creating a Branch for a New Feature</h4>
            <p>You want to develop a new feature without affecting the main codebase:</p>
            <div class="code-example">
                <code>git branch new-feature</code>
                <code>git checkout new-feature</code>
                <code># Or in one command:</code>
                <code>git checkout -b new-feature</code>
            </div>
            <p>This is like creating a parallel universe where you can experiment safely.</p>

        <section class="real-world-applications">
            <h3>Version Control in Real-World Development</h3>
            
            <h4>Open Source Collaboration</h4>
            <p>Version control enables thousands of developers worldwide to contribute to projects like Python, Django, and Flask. Without Git, projects like the Linux kernel (with thousands of contributors) would be nearly impossible to manage.</p>
            
            <h4>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</h4>
            <p>Modern development workflows use version control as the foundation for automated testing and deployment pipelines. Each commit can trigger tests, and successful builds on specific branches can automatically deploy to staging or production environments.</p>
            
            <h4>Software Archaeology</h4>
            <p>When bugs appear in production, developers can use version control history to identify when the issue was introduced and why, making troubleshooting much more efficient.</p>
            
            <h4>Code Reviews</h4>
            <p>Version control platforms like GitHub facilitate code reviews through pull requests, where changes can be discussed, improved, and approved before being merged into the main codebase.</p>
