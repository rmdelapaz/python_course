            <h3>Purpose of Our Q&A Session</h3>
            <p>Welcome to our Q&A session! This interactive session is designed to address any questions, confusions, or curiosities that have emerged during our first week of learning. Think of this as our "debug session" – a chance to identify and resolve any blockers before moving forward, ensuring everyone has a solid foundation.</p>
            
            <p>Questions are the engines of learning. When you ask questions, you're not just seeking information; you're actively engaging with the material and identifying the exact areas where your understanding can grow. The best developers aren't those who never have questions – they're the ones who know how to ask good questions and seek effective answers.</p>
            
            <p>Today's session will follow a structured but flexible format:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First, we'll address common questions submitted beforehand</li>
                <li>Then, we'll open the floor for live questions</li>
                <li>Finally, we'll explore some deeper conceptual questions that connect our week's learning to real-world scenarios</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Remember, there are no "stupid questions" in this space – only opportunities to deepen our collective understanding.</p>

            <h3>Common Questions About Web Development Fundamentals</h3>
            
            <h4>Understanding HTTP Deeply</h4>
            <div class="qa_pair">
                <p class="question"><strong>Q: What's the difference between HTTP and HTTPS, and why does it matter for our applications?</strong></p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web. HTTPS (HTTP Secure) adds a layer of encryption using SSL/TLS. This difference is like sending a postcard (HTTP) versus sending a letter in a sealed envelope (HTTPS).</p>
                    
                    <p>Why it matters:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Security:</strong> HTTPS encrypts all data transmitted between client and server, protecting sensitive information like passwords and personal data</li>
                        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> HTTPS verifies that your users are communicating with the actual website they intended to visit, not an impostor</li>
                        <li><strong>SEO and User Trust:</strong> Modern browsers flag HTTP sites as "Not Secure," and search engines give preference to HTTPS sites</li>
                        <li><strong>Modern API Access:</strong> Many modern browser features (geolocation, camera access, etc.) are only available on secure origins (HTTPS)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>In development, we often use HTTP for simplicity, but for production applications, HTTPS is essential. Later in the course, we'll cover how to implement HTTPS in your applications using certificates and proper configuration.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> When you log into your banking website, the connection uses HTTPS. You can verify this by looking at the padlock icon in your browser's address bar. This ensures that your login credentials and account information are encrypted during transmission.</p>

            <h4>The Client-Server Model in Practice</h4>
            <div class="qa_pair">
                <p class="question"><strong>Q: In a full-stack application, what responsibilities belong to the client versus the server, and how do they communicate?</strong></p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The client-server relationship is like a restaurant interaction between customers and kitchen staff. Let's break down their responsibilities:</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Client Responsibilities:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User interface presentation and rendering</li>
                        <li>Input validation (for user experience, but never as the only validation)</li>
                        <li>Local state management</li>
                        <li>Sending requests to the server</li>
                        <li>Processing and displaying server responses</li>
                        <li>Handling client-side routing</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Server Responsibilities:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Processing requests from clients</li>
                        <li>Authentication and authorization</li>
                        <li>Business logic execution</li>
                        <li>Data validation (critical for security)</li>
                        <li>Database interactions</li>
                        <li>Returning appropriate responses (data, status codes)</li>
                        <li>Maintaining application state across requests (when needed)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Communication:</strong></p>
                    <p>Clients and servers communicate through HTTP requests and responses. This communication typically follows these patterns:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>REST APIs:</strong> Structured around resources and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)</li>
                        <li><strong>GraphQL:</strong> A query language allowing clients to request exactly the data they need</li>
                        <li><strong>WebSockets:</strong> Enables real-time bidirectional communication</li>
                        <li><strong>Server-Sent Events:</strong> Allows servers to push updates to clients</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> In a social media application like Twitter, when you post a tweet, the client (your browser or app) sends an HTTP POST request to the server. The server validates the content, saves it to a database, processes any hashtags or mentions, and returns a response with the status of your post. Your client then updates the interface to show your new tweet.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h4>Web Browsers Behind the Scenes</h4>
            <div class="qa_pair">
                <p class="question"><strong>Q: What exactly happens when a browser loads a web page? How does this affect our development approach?</strong></p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Loading a web page involves a complex sequence of events that's important to understand for optimizing performance. Think of it like a play with multiple acts happening in sequence:</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Page Loading Process:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>DNS Resolution:</strong> Converts domain names (like example.com) to IP addresses</li>
                        <li><strong>TCP Connection:</strong> Establishes a connection with the server</li>
                        <li><strong>TLS Negotiation:</strong> For HTTPS sites, establishes encryption</li>
                        <li><strong>HTTP Request:</strong> Browser sends request for the HTML document</li>
                        <li><strong>Server Processing:</strong> Server processes the request and returns HTML</li>
                        <li><strong>HTML Parsing:</strong> Browser begins parsing the HTML document</li>
                        <li><strong>Asset Discovery and Loading:</strong> Browser discovers and requests CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>DOM Construction:</strong> Builds the Document Object Model from HTML</li>
                        <li><strong>CSSOM Construction:</strong> Builds the CSS Object Model from stylesheets</li>
                        <li><strong>Render Tree Construction:</strong> Combines DOM and CSSOM</li>
                        <li><strong>Layout:</strong> Calculates the position and size of each visible element</li>
                        <li><strong>Paint:</strong> Fills in pixels for each visual element</li>
                        <li><strong>JavaScript Execution:</strong> Runs scripts that may modify the DOM</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p><strong>Development Implications:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Understanding this process helps you minimize render-blocking resources, optimize asset loading, and improve perceived performance</li>
                        <li><strong>Progressive Enhancement:</strong> Building core functionality with HTML first ensures basic usability even before all resources load</li>
                        <li><strong>Critical Rendering Path:</strong> Prioritizing "above the fold" content improves perceived loading speed</li>
                        <li><strong>Asynchronous Loading:</strong> Using async/defer attributes for scripts that aren't immediately needed</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This process is similar to a restaurant experience. DNS resolution is finding the restaurant address; TCP connection is traveling there; HTML parsing is reading the menu; asset loading is ordering various dishes; rendering is the food being prepared and served; and JavaScript execution is customizing your meal after it arrives.</p>
                    
                    <p>As full-stack developers, we need to optimize both the server response time (how quickly the "kitchen" prepares orders) and the client rendering process (how efficiently the "meal" is served and presented).</p>

            <h4>Docker Workflow Challenges</h4>
            <div class="qa_pair">
                <p class="question"><strong>Q: I'm struggling with Docker volumes and file permissions. Why do my files sometimes show up as owned by 'root' when I use volumes, and how can I fix this?</strong></p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>This is a common Docker pain point that stems from how Linux permissions work. When Docker mounts a volume, the files inside the container are owned by the user running the process inside the container (often 'root'), which may not match your host system user.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Understanding the Problem:</strong></p>
                    <p>Imagine you have two houses (host and container) with different security systems. When you share a room (volume) between them, the security permissions from one house might not make sense in the other.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Use User Namespaces:</strong> Specify the user ID in your Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml:
                        <pre><code># In Dockerfile
USER 1000:1000

# Or in docker-compose.yml
services:
  app:
    user: "1000:1000"</code></pre>
                        <p>Replace 1000 with your host user ID (find with <code>id -u</code> on Linux/Mac)</p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Set Permissions in Entrypoint:</strong> Use an entrypoint script to adjust permissions:
                        <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# entrypoint.sh
chown -R user:user /app
exec "$@"</code></pre>
                        <p>Add to Dockerfile:
                        <pre><code>COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["python", "app.py"]</code></pre></p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Use Named Volumes:</strong> For persistent data, use named volumes instead of bind mounts:
                        <pre><code>volumes:
  - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  postgres_data:</code></pre>
                        <p>This approach lets Docker manage the volume permissions</p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Use Docker Desktop on Windows/Mac:</strong> Docker Desktop has improved handling of permissions across operating systems</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p><strong>Best Practice for Development:</strong></p>
                    <p>For development environments, a common pattern is to:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a non-root user in your Dockerfile with known UID/GID</li>
                        <li>Set ownership of application directories to that user</li>
                        <li>Run the container process as that user</li>
                        <li>Use bind mounts for code (read-write) and named volumes for data</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p><strong>Example docker-compose.yml:</strong></p>
                    <pre><code>version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile

                    <p><strong>Real-world scenario:</strong> In professional environments, development teams often use Docker Compose with development-specific configurations that address these permission issues. For production, they might use orchestration tools like Kubernetes that handle permissions differently.</p>

            <h4>Git Workflow Questions</h4>
            <div class="qa_pair">
                <p class="question"><strong>Q: What's the recommended Git branching strategy for our course projects, and how do we handle merge conflicts effectively?</strong></p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Git branching strategies organize your development workflow, much like how traffic patterns organize the flow of vehicles on roads. Let's cover both the recommended strategy and conflict resolution.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Recommended Branching Strategy: GitHub Flow</strong></p>
                    <p>For our course projects, we'll use a simplified version of GitHub Flow, which balances simplicity with best practices:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Main Branch:</strong> The <code>main</code> branch always contains stable, deployable code</li>
                        <li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Create branches for new features or bug fixes
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use descriptive names: <code>feature/user-authentication</code> or <code>fix/login-validation</code></li>
                                <li>Branch from <code>main</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Regular Commits:</strong> Commit changes frequently with clear messages
                            <ul>
                                <li>Follow the format: <code>type: concise description</code></li>
                                <li>Types include: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore</li>
                                <li>Example: <code>feat: add user registration form</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Pull Requests:</strong> When a feature is complete, create a pull request to merge into <code>main</code>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Include a description of changes</li>
                                <li>Reference any related issues</li>
                                <li>Request reviews from team members</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Code Review:</strong> Have at least one other person review your code</li>
                        <li><strong>Merge:</strong> After approval, merge the feature branch into <code>main</code></li>
                        <li><strong>Delete Branch:</strong> Delete the feature branch after merging</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p><strong>Handling Merge Conflicts</strong></p>
                    <p>Merge conflicts occur when Git can't automatically reconcile differences between branches. Think of them as two chefs trying to modify the same recipe in different ways.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Prevention strategies:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Frequent Integration:</strong> Pull from <code>main</code> regularly to stay in sync</li>
                        <li><strong>Focused Features:</strong> Keep feature branches small and targeted</li>
                        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Coordinate with teammates on who's working on which files</li>
                        <li><strong>Clear Ownership:</strong> Assign clear ownership for different parts of the codebase</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Resolution process:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Understand the Conflict:</strong> Git marks conflicts with special syntax:
                        <pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
Current branch code
=======
Incoming branch code
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feature/branch-name</code></pre></li>
                        <li><strong>Resolve Each Conflict:</strong> Edit the file to keep the correct code and remove conflict markers</li>
                        <li><strong>Test the Solution:</strong> Ensure your resolution works correctly</li>
                        <li><strong>Mark as Resolved:</strong> Use <code>git add [file]</code> to mark as resolved</li>
                        <li><strong>Complete the Merge:</strong> Continue with <code>git merge --continue</code> or <code>git commit</code></li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p><strong>Tools for resolving conflicts:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>VS Code:</strong> Built-in merge conflict resolution tools</li>
                        <li><strong>GitLens:</strong> Enhanced visualization of conflicts</li>
                        <li><strong>Git GUI tools:</strong> SourceTree, GitKraken, GitHub Desktop</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> At a tech company I worked with, the team adopted a rule that whoever creates a pull request is responsible for resolving conflicts with the target branch. This incentivized developers to regularly sync with the main branch to minimize conflicts.</p>

                    <p><strong>Python's Role in Modern Web Architecture:</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Python has adapted remarkably well throughout this evolution:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Backend Services:</strong> Python excels at building API services (Flask, FastAPI) and full-stack applications (Django)</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Python's strength in data analysis makes it ideal for data-intensive applications</li>
                        <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Python dominates the ML landscape, enabling intelligent web applications</li>
                        <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Python powers infrastructure automation, CI/CD pipelines, and DevOps workflows</li>
                        <li><strong>Serverless:</strong> Python is well-supported in serverless platforms (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Containerization's Impact:</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Containerization (with Docker) has transformed how we develop and deploy Python web applications:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Environment Consistency:</strong> Eliminates "works on my machine" problems</li>
                        <li><strong>Microservices Enablement:</strong> Facilitates breaking applications into smaller, independent services</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Containers can be easily replicated for horizontal scaling</li>
                        <li><strong>Resource Efficiency:</strong> Lighter than virtual machines, enabling denser deployment</li>
                        <li><strong>Orchestration:</strong> Kubernetes manages container deployment, scaling, and networking</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Current Architectural Patterns with Python:</strong></p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>API-First Development:</strong> Python services providing RESTful or GraphQL APIs consumed by frontend applications</li>
                        <li><strong>Microservices:</strong> Small, focused Python services communicating via HTTP or message queues</li>
                        <li><strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong> Python services reacting to events in message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ</li>
                        <li><strong>Serverless Functions:</strong> Python functions triggered by events (HTTP requests, database changes, etc.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Hybrid Rendering:</strong> Server-side rendering for initial load, client-side rendering for interactions</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Companies like Instagram use Python (Django) for their backend services, deployed as containerized microservices. They combine this with React for the frontend, achieving a scalable, maintainable architecture that serves billions of users.</p>

            <h4>Development Workflow Philosophy</h4>
            <div class="qa_pair">
                <p class="question"><strong>Q: How do the tools we're learning (Git, Docker, VS Code) reflect software development philosophy, and how might they change our approach to problem-solving?</strong></p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>The tools we use aren't just practical utilities – they embody philosophical approaches to software development that shape how we think about problems. This is similar to how learning a new language doesn't just give you words, but introduces new ways of conceptualizing the world.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Git: The Philosophy of History and Collaboration</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Git embodies several philosophical principles:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Non-linear Progress:</strong> Branching acknowledges that development doesn't follow a straight line</li>
                        <li><strong>Atomic Changes:</strong> Commits encourage thinking in terms of discrete, logical units of work</li>
                        <li><strong>Accountability and Transparency:</strong> Commit history creates a narrative of decisions and their authors</li>
                        <li><strong>Parallel Experimentation:</strong> Branches enable exploration without commitment</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>How Git Changes Our Thinking:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We become more deliberate about changes, thinking "What's the atomic unit of work here?"</li>
                        <li>We consider the narrative our code tells through its history</li>
                        <li>We think in terms of reversible decisions rather than permanent ones</li>
                        <li>We develop comfort with parallel streams of work</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Docker: The Philosophy of Environment as Code</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Docker represents these philosophical approaches:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Infrastructure as Code:</strong> Treating environments as programmable, version-controlled artifacts</li>
                        <li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Containers are immutable, encouraging stateless application design</li>
                        <li><strong>Isolation and Boundaries:</strong> Clear separation of concerns between components</li>
                        <li><strong>Reproducibility:</strong> Deterministic environments eliminate variables</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>How Docker Changes Our Thinking:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We begin to treat infrastructure as part of the application, not separate</li>
                        <li>We design applications with clearer boundaries and interfaces</li>
                        <li>We think more about statelessness and idempotence</li>
                        <li>We expect reproducibility as a fundamental requirement</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>VS Code: The Philosophy of Integrated Development</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>VS Code reflects these philosophical stances:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tool Consolidation:</strong> Bringing multiple capabilities into a unified environment</li>
                        <li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> Users can shape their environment to match their workflow</li>
                        <li><strong>Feedback Loops:</strong> Immediate validation through linting, testing, and debugging</li>
                        <li><strong>Cognitive Offloading:</strong> Tools handle mechanical aspects so humans can focus on creative ones</li>

                    <p><strong>How VS Code Changes Our Thinking:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We expect faster feedback cycles for validation</li>
                        <li>We customize our environment to match our cognitive process</li>
                        <li>We offload mechanical tasks to tools, focusing on higher-level problems</li>
                        <li>We integrate previously separate workflows (coding, testing, debugging, deploying)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>The Combined Philosophy: Development as a Holistic System</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Together, these tools promote a holistic approach to development:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Focus on Value, Not Mechanics:</strong> Automating routine tasks to focus on business value</li>
                        <li><strong>Everything as Code:</strong> Version control for code, infrastructure, and configuration</li>
                        <li><strong>Continuous Feedback:</strong> Fast validation cycles throughout development</li>
                        <li><strong>Reproducibility:</strong> Consistent environments across development, testing, and production</li>
                        <li><strong>Collaboration by Design:</strong> Tools built around team workflows, not just individual productivity</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Real-world transformation:</strong> A developer who internalizes these philosophies approaches problems differently. Instead of asking "How do I implement this feature?", they ask "How do I design this system so it's testable, deployable, maintainable, and collaborative?" The scope of concern expands from just code to the entire development and delivery process.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> It's like the difference between a chef who just follows recipes and one who understands the science of cooking, the logistics of kitchen management, and the art of presentation. The latter can create new dishes and run a successful restaurant, while the former is limited to execution of predefined steps.</p>

            <h3>Troubleshooting Common Week 1 Issues</h3>
            
            <h4>Docker Installation Problems</h4>
            <div class="qa_pair">
                <p class="question"><strong>Q: I'm having issues with Docker on Windows. The containers won't start properly, or they're extremely slow.</strong></p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Docker on Windows can present unique challenges because it relies on virtualization technology that interacts with your specific hardware and Windows configuration. Here's a systematic approach to resolving common issues:</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Ensuring Proper Installation Requirements:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>WSL 2 Configuration:</strong> Docker Desktop for Windows works best with WSL 2
                            <ul>
                                <li>Run <code>wsl --update</code> to ensure you have the latest WSL version</li>
                                <li>Verify WSL 2 is your default: <code>wsl --set-default-version 2</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Virtualization:</strong> Ensure virtualization is enabled in BIOS/UEFI
                            <ul>
                                <li>Check Task Manager's Performance tab for "Virtualization: Enabled"</li>
                                <li>If disabled, restart computer and enter BIOS settings to enable it (often under Advanced Settings)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Windows Features:</strong> Ensure required Windows features are enabled
                            <ul>
                                <li>Go to Control Panel → Programs → Windows Features</li>
                                <li>Enable: Hyper-V, Virtual Machine Platform, Windows Subsystem for Linux</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Performance Issues:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Docker Desktop may need more resources
                            <ul>
                                <li>Open Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources</li>
                                <li>Increase CPU allocation (at least 2 cores)</li>
                                <li>Increase Memory (at least 4GB for development work)</li>
                                <li>Adjust Swap size based on your needs</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Storage Location:</strong> WSL 2 storage location can affect performance
                            <ul>
                                <li>Consider moving WSL 2 to an SSD if available</li>
                                <li>Use <code>wsl --export</code> and <code>wsl --import</code> to relocate</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Volume Mounting:</strong> Windows and WSL paths can cause performance issues
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use WSL paths instead of Windows paths in volume mounts when possible</li>
                                <li>Add <code>:cached</code> or <code>:delegated</code> to volume mounts in docker-compose.yml</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Network Issues:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Firewall Interference:</strong> Windows Defender or other firewalls may block Docker networking
                            <ul>
                                <li>Check firewall settings and create exceptions for Docker</li>
                                <li>Temporarily disable firewall to test if it's the cause</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>VPN Conflicts:</strong> VPN software can interfere with Docker networking
                            <ul>
                                <li>Disconnect from VPN temporarily to test</li>
                                <li>Configure VPN to allow local network traffic</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Docker Network Issues:</strong> Reset Docker networking when problems persist
                            <ul>
                                <li>Run <code>docker network prune</code> to remove unused networks</li>
                                <li>In extreme cases, reset Docker to factory defaults in Settings</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Alternative Approach:</strong> If Docker Desktop continues to cause problems, consider running Python directly in WSL 2 without Docker for development. This provides many of the same benefits (Linux environment, isolation from Windows) with potentially fewer compatibility issues.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Real-world solution:</strong> In a recent project, we found that Docker Desktop performance was poor for team members using Windows. Our solution was to develop a hybrid approach: using Docker for running databases and services, but running the Python application directly in WSL 2 during development. This gave us the best of both worlds - containerized dependencies but native performance for the code we were actively changing.</p>

            <h4>Python Virtual Environment Issues</h4>
            <div class="qa_pair">
                <p class="question"><strong>Q: My VS Code doesn't recognize my Python virtual environment, and I'm getting "module not found" errors even though I've installed the packages.</strong></p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Virtual environment issues can be frustrating because they create a disconnect between what you've installed and what your editor or interpreter can access. Let's diagnose and solve these common problems:</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Understanding Virtual Environments:</strong></p>
                    <p>Think of a virtual environment as a separate "room" for a Python project. Each room has its own set of packages, isolated from other rooms. VS Code needs to know which room to look in.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Common Issues and Solutions:</strong></p>
                    
                    <ol>

                                        <li>Look for your virtual environment in the list (usually named "venv" or ".venv")</li>
                                        <li>If not visible, click "Enter interpreter path" and browse to the Python executable in your virtual environment:

                        <li><strong>Standardize Environment Locations:</strong> Always create virtual environments in the same relative location in your projects (e.g., always use ".venv" in the project root)</li>
                        <li><strong>Use Project-Specific Settings:</strong> Create a .vscode/settings.json file in your project to specify the Python path:
                        <pre><code>{
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python",
    "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true
}</code></pre></li>
                        <li><strong>Consider Environment Management Tools:</strong> Tools like Poetry or Pipenv can simplify environment management</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Real-world practice:</strong> Many professional developers create a shell script or batch file called <code>dev_setup.sh</code> that creates the virtual environment, installs dependencies, and configures VS Code settings for a project. This ensures everyone on the team has an identical setup process.</p>

            <h3>Open Floor: Your Questions</h3>
            
            <p>Now it's time for your specific questions! This is an opportunity to address any aspects of Week 1 material that you'd like clarified or expanded upon.</p>
            
            <p>When asking questions, try to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> "How do I configure VS Code to use Black for formatting?" is better than "How do I set up VS Code?"</li>
                <li><strong>Provide context:</strong> Mention your operating system or specific error messages you're seeing</li>
                <li><strong>Connect to your goals:</strong> Explaining why you're asking can help us provide more relevant answers</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>No question is too basic or too advanced. The most valuable questions are often those that many people have but hesitate to ask.</p>

            <h3>Looking Ahead to Week 2</h3>
            
            <p>As we wrap up our Q&A session, let's preview what's coming in Week 2: Python Fundamentals (Part 1).</p>
            
            <p>Next week, we'll build on our development environment to start writing Python code. We'll cover:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monday:</strong> Introduction to Python and its philosophy, variables, data types, and basic operations</li>
                <li><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Control structures - conditionals, loops, and flow control</li>
                <li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Data structures - lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets</li>
                <li><strong>Thursday:</strong> Functions, parameters, return values, and scope</li>
                <li><strong>Friday:</strong> Modules, packages, and the Python standard library</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The tools we've set up this week (VS Code, Git, Docker) will become our workshop for building Python applications. Just as a carpenter needs to set up their workshop before building furniture, we've prepared our environment for productive Python development.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Preparation suggestions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete the weekend project to ensure your development environment is fully functional</li>
                <li>Experiment with Git commands to become comfortable with version control workflows</li>
                <li>Review basic programming concepts if you're new to coding</li>
                <li>Bookmark the official Python documentation (python.org/docs/) as a reference</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Remember that learning to code is like learning a language - consistent practice is more effective than cramming. Try to spend a little time with Python every day, even if it's just 20-30 minutes of exploration.</p>
