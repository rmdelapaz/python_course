            <h2>Introduction to HTTP</h2>
            
            <p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web. If the internet were a postal service, HTTP would be the standardized format for writing addresses, packaging contents, and delivering mail.</p>
            
            <p>Developed by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in the early 1990s, HTTP was designed as a communication protocol for the World Wide Web. It defines how messages should be formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Characteristics of HTTP</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stateless</strong>: Each request from a client to a server is treated as a brand new request with no memory of previous interactions. This is like calling a help desk where each call is handled as if it's your first time calling, regardless of your history.</li>
                <li><strong>Text-based</strong>: HTTP messages are readable text, making debugging easier. This is similar to sending a letter with clear human-readable instructions rather than encrypted code.</li>
                <li><strong>Request-response pattern</strong>: Communication always begins with a client request and ends with a server response, like a conversation where one person always speaks first, and the other always responds.</li>
                <li><strong>Application layer protocol</strong>: HTTP operates at the application layer of the network stack, relying on lower-level protocols like TCP/IP for transmission.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>HTTP has evolved over time, with major versions including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTTP/1.0</strong>: Basic version with one request-response per connection (1996)</li>
                <li><strong>HTTP/1.1</strong>: Added persistent connections, chunked transfers, and more (1997)</li>
                <li><strong>HTTP/2</strong>: Improved performance with multiplexing, server push, and compression (2015)</li>
                <li><strong>HTTP/3</strong>: Further improvements with QUIC protocol for reduced latency (2022)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>The Request-Response Cycle</h2>
            
            <p>When you type a URL in your browser and press Enter, you initiate what we call the "request-response cycle." This fundamental process is the heartbeat of the web.</p>
            
            <h3>Anatomy of the Cycle</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Request Formulation</strong>: Your browser creates an HTTP request based on your action (typing a URL, clicking a link, submitting a form, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Request Transmission</strong>: The request travels through the internet to reach the appropriate server</li>
                <li><strong>Request Processing</strong>: The server receives the request, interprets it, and performs the necessary operations</li>
                <li><strong>Response Generation</strong>: The server creates an HTTP response, including status information and requested content</li>
                <li><strong>Response Transmission</strong>: The response travels back to your browser</li>
                <li><strong>Response Processing</strong>: Your browser receives the response, interprets it, and displays the content</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This process happens countless times as you browse the web, usually in milliseconds!</p>
            
            <h3>A Real-World Example</h3>
            <p>Let's walk through what happens when you visit a blog post:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You click a link to "myblog.com/posts/hello-world"</li>
                <li>Your browser creates an HTTP GET request to that URL</li>
                <li>The request travels to the myblog.com server</li>
                <li>The server identifies that you want the "hello-world" post</li>
                <li>The server fetches the post content from a database</li>
                <li>The server generates an HTML page containing the post</li>
                <li>The server sends an HTTP response with status 200 (OK) and the HTML content</li>
                <li>Your browser receives the HTML and displays it</li>
                <li>Your browser finds references to CSS, JavaScript, and images in the HTML</li>
                <li>Your browser makes additional HTTP requests for each referenced resource</li>
                <li>The server responds to each request with the appropriate files</li>
                <li>Your browser renders the complete page with all resources</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This entire process typically takes less than a second but involves multiple request-response cycles for a single page load.</p>
            
            <h3>Request-Response in Developer Tools</h3>
            <p>Modern browsers include developer tools that let you observe this cycle in action. Try the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I in most browsers)</li>
                <li>Go to the "Network" tab</li>
                <li>Visit a website</li>
                <li>Observe the list of requests that populate the network panel</li>
                <li>Click on any request to see detailed information about the request and response</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This visibility into the request-response cycle is an invaluable tool for web developers, allowing you to debug issues, optimize performance, and understand how web applications behave.</p>

            <h2>HTTP Methods</h2>
            
            <p>HTTP defines several methods (or verbs) that indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource. These methods are the vocabulary of web communication, each with a specific purpose and behavior.</p>
            
            <h3>Primary HTTP Methods</h3>
            <div class="table-container">
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Method</th>
                            <th>Purpose</th>
                            <th>Real-World Analogy</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>GET</strong></td>
                            <td>Retrieve data from the server</td>
                            <td>Browsing books in a library without changing anything</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>POST</strong></td>
                            <td>Submit data to create a new resource</td>
                            <td>Submitting a new book to add to the library collection</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>PUT</strong></td>
                            <td>Update an existing resource with new data (complete replacement)</td>
                            <td>Replacing an entire book with a new edition</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>PATCH</strong></td>
                            <td>Partially update an existing resource</td>
                            <td>Correcting specific pages in a book without replacing the whole book</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><strong>DELETE</strong></td>
                            <td>Remove a specified resource</td>
                            <td>Removing a book from the library collection</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Additional HTTP Methods</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HEAD</strong>: Similar to GET but retrieves only headers, not the body (like checking if a book exists without actually taking it off the shelf)</li>
                <li><strong>OPTIONS</strong>: Retrieves the HTTP methods that the server supports (like asking the library what actions you're allowed to take)</li>
                <li><strong>CONNECT</strong>: Establishes a tunnel to the server (like creating a direct phone line to a librarian)</li>
                <li><strong>TRACE</strong>: Performs a message loop-back test (like tracking how your request moves through the library system)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Characteristics of HTTP Methods</h3>
            <h4>Safety</h4>
            <p>A method is considered "safe" if it doesn't alter the server state. GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS are safe methods because they only retrieve information without changing anything. This is like reading a book without making any notes or dog-ears.</p>
            
            <h4>Idempotence</h4>
            <p>A method is "idempotent" if multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request. GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS are idempotent. For example, deleting a resource multiple times has the same effect as deleting it onceâ€”it's still gone.</p>
            
            <h3>Choosing the Right Method</h3>
            <p>Selecting the appropriate HTTP method is crucial for designing clear, predictable, and maintainable web applications. Here are some guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use <strong>GET</strong> when retrieving data without side effects</li>
                <li>Use <strong>POST</strong> when creating new resources or when an operation has side effects</li>
                <li>Use <strong>PUT</strong> when replacing an entire resource with a new version</li>
                <li>Use <strong>PATCH</strong> when making partial updates to a resource</li>
                <li>Use <strong>DELETE</strong> when removing a resource</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Following these conventions makes your APIs more intuitive and aligned with web standards, improving both developer experience and application robustness.</p>

            <h2>HTTP Status Codes</h2>
            
            <p>HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers that servers include in their responses to indicate the outcome of the request. Think of them as the "reaction" part of a conversation, telling you whether your request was understood, accepted, or if there was a problem.</p>
            
            <h3>Status Code Categories</h3>
            <p>Status codes are grouped into five categories, each with a specific meaning:</p>
            
            <h4>1xx: Informational</h4>
            <p>These codes indicate that the request was received and the process is continuing. They're like someone saying "I heard you, I'm working on it" during a conversation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>100 Continue</strong>: The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed to send the request body</li>
                <li><strong>101 Switching Protocols</strong>: The server is switching protocols as requested by the client</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>2xx: Success</h4>
            <p>These codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted. They're the equivalent of "Yes, here's what you asked for" in a conversation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>200 OK</strong>: The request succeeded and the response contains the requested content</li>
                <li><strong>201 Created</strong>: The request succeeded and a new resource was created</li>
                <li><strong>204 No Content</strong>: The request succeeded but there's no content to return</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>3xx: Redirection</h4>
            <p>These codes indicate that further action is needed to complete the request. They're like someone saying "What you're looking for is over there now" in a conversation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>301 Moved Permanently</strong>: The resource has been permanently moved to a new URL</li>
                <li><strong>302 Found</strong>: The resource is temporarily located at a different URL</li>
                <li><strong>304 Not Modified</strong>: The client's cached version of the resource is still valid</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>4xx: Client Error</h4>
            <p>These codes indicate that the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled. They're equivalent to "I don't understand what you're asking for" or "I can't do that" in a conversation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>400 Bad Request</strong>: The server can't understand the request due to malformed syntax</li>
                <li><strong>401 Unauthorized</strong>: Authentication is required and has failed or not been provided</li>
                <li><strong>403 Forbidden</strong>: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it</li>
                <li><strong>404 Not Found</strong>: The requested resource couldn't be found on the server</li>
                <li><strong>405 Method Not Allowed</strong>: The request method is not supported for the requested resource</li>
                <li><strong>429 Too Many Requests</strong>: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>5xx: Server Error</h4>
            <p>These codes indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request. They're like someone saying "I understand what you want, but I'm having problems fulfilling your request" in a conversation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong>: A generic error message when the server encounters an unexpected condition</li>
                <li><strong>502 Bad Gateway</strong>: The server was acting as a gateway and received an invalid response</li>
                <li><strong>503 Service Unavailable</strong>: The server is temporarily unable to handle the request</li>
                <li><strong>504 Gateway Timeout</strong>: The server was acting as a gateway and didn't receive a timely response</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Why Status Codes Matter</h3>
            <p>Status codes are crucial for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Debugging</strong>: They help developers identify and fix issues in web applications</li>
                <li><strong>User Experience</strong>: They allow applications to provide appropriate feedback to users</li>
                <li><strong>Automation</strong>: They enable programmatic handling of different response scenarios</li>
                <li><strong>SEO</strong>: Search engines use status codes to understand website structure and content availability</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>As a web developer, you'll regularly work with status codes, both in responding to client requests from your server-side code and in handling responses from external APIs in your client-side code.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>HTTP Headers</h2>
            
            <p>HTTP headers are additional pieces of information sent with HTTP requests and responses. They provide context and metadata about the request or response, allowing clients and servers to communicate more effectively.</p>
            
            <p>Think of headers as the envelope and instructions that accompany a letter. While the letter itself (the body) contains the main message, the envelope and any notes on it provide important information about how to handle, deliver, and interpret the contents.</p>
            
            <h3>Common Request Headers</h3>
            <p>Request headers are sent from the client to the server:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accept</strong>: Indicates which content types the client can understand (e.g., "Accept: text/html,application/json")</li>
                <li><strong>Authorization</strong>: Contains credentials for authenticating the client (e.g., "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsI...")</li>
                <li><strong>User-Agent</strong>: Identifies the client software (e.g., "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36")</li>
                <li><strong>Content-Type</strong>: Specifies the format of the request body (e.g., "Content-Type: application/json")</li>
                <li><strong>Cookie</strong>: Contains stored HTTP cookies previously sent by the server (e.g., "Cookie: session_id=abc123; user_preference=dark_mode")</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Common Response Headers</h3>
            <p>Response headers are sent from the server to the client:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Content-Type</strong>: Indicates the media type of the response body (e.g., "Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8")</li>
                <li><strong>Content-Length</strong>: Specifies the size of the response body in bytes (e.g., "Content-Length: 348")</li>
                <li><strong>Set-Cookie</strong>: Sends cookies from the server to be stored by the client (e.g., "Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; Path=/; HttpOnly")</li>
                <li><strong>Cache-Control</strong>: Directives for caching mechanisms (e.g., "Cache-Control: max-age=3600, must-revalidate")</li>
                <li><strong>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</strong>: Specifies which origins can access the resource, part of CORS (e.g., "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com")</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Headers in Action</h3>
            <p>Here's an example of a complete HTTP request with headers:</p>
            <pre><code>GET /api/users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36
</code></pre>
            
            <p>And a corresponding response:</p>
            <pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 234
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "role": "administrator"
}
</code></pre>
            
            <h3>Working with Headers in Web Development</h3>
            <p>As a web developer, you'll interact with headers in several ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Setting response headers</strong> in your server-side code to control browser behavior</li>
                <li><strong>Reading request headers</strong> to understand client capabilities and preferences</li>
                <li><strong>Setting request headers</strong> when making API calls from your applications</li>
                <li><strong>Debugging header-related issues</strong> using browser developer tools</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Understanding HTTP headers is essential for implementing important web features like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Authentication and authorization</li>
                <li>Caching strategies</li>
                <li>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</li>
                <li>Content negotiation</li>
                <li>Security policies</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Let's put all this together by examining a complete HTTP request-response cycle for a simple web page. This example will show how the concepts we've discussed work in practice.</p>
            
            <h3>The Scenario</h3>
            <p>Imagine a user visiting a blog at "https://myblog.com/posts/hello-world".</p>
            
            <h3>The HTTP Request</h3>
            <pre><code>GET /posts/hello-world HTTP/1.1
Host: myblog.com
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: keep-alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36
Cookie: session_id=user123; theme=light
</code></pre>
            
            <p>In this request:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>GET method</strong> indicates the client wants to retrieve information</li>
                <li>The <strong>path</strong> (/posts/hello-world) specifies which resource is being requested</li>
                <li>The <strong>Host header</strong> identifies which website to connect to</li>
                <li>The <strong>Accept header</strong> indicates the client prefers HTML content</li>
                <li>The <strong>User-Agent header</strong> identifies the browser making the request</li>
                <li>The <strong>Cookie header</strong> sends previously stored cookies to the server</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Server Processing</h3>
            <p>When the server receives this request, it might:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Validate the session cookie to identify the user</li>
                <li>Query a database for the "hello-world" post content</li>
                <li>Check if the user has permission to view this post</li>
                <li>Generate HTML for the post, possibly incorporating the user's theme preference</li>
                <li>Prepare an HTTP response with the appropriate status code and headers</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>The HTTP Response</h3>
            <pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 5362
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
Set-Cookie: last_visit=2025-04-15T10:15:30Z; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Hello World - My Blog</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css">
</head>
<body class="theme-light">
    <header>
        <h1>My Blog</h1>
        <nav><!-- Navigation links --></nav>
    </header>
    <main>
        <article>
            <h1>Hello World</h1>
            <time datetime="2025-04-10">April 10, 2025</time>
            <p>This is my first blog post. Welcome to my blog!</p>
            <!-- More content... -->
        </article>
    </main>
    <footer><!-- Footer content --></footer>
    <script src="/js/main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
</code></pre>
            
            <p>In this response:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>200 status code</strong> indicates the request was successful</li>
                <li>The <strong>Content-Type header</strong> specifies that the response contains HTML</li>
                <li>The <strong>Content-Length header</strong> indicates the size of the response body</li>
                <li>The <strong>Cache-Control header</strong> tells the browser to cache the page for an hour</li>
                <li>The <strong>Set-Cookie header</strong> updates the user's last visit timestamp</li>
                <li>The <strong>body</strong> contains the HTML for the blog post</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Subsequent Requests</h3>
            <p>After receiving and parsing the HTML, the browser will make additional requests for the referenced resources:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A request for "/css/style.css"</li>
                <li>A request for "/js/main.js"</li>
                <li>Requests for any images or other media referenced in the HTML</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Each of these follows the same request-response pattern, building up the complete page experience for the user.</p>
            
            <h3>Analyzing with Developer Tools</h3>
            <p>You can observe similar exchanges in your own browser:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)</li>
                <li>Navigate to the Network tab</li>
                <li>Visit a webpage</li>
                <li>Select any request in the list to view its details, including headers, status, and content</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This hands-on exploration is one of the best ways to deepen your understanding of HTTP and the request-response cycle.</p>
