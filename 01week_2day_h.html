            <h3>The Gateway to Collaborative Coding</h3>
            
            <p>A GitHub repository is the digital home for your project. It's where your code lives, evolves, and collaborates with other developers. 
            Creating your first repository is a significant milestone in your development journeyâ€”it's the moment your code becomes part of the larger 
            programming ecosystem.</p>
            
            <p>Think of a GitHub repository as a project workspace that includes not just your code, but also its complete history, documentation, and 
            collaborative tools. It's akin to an artist's studio where every brushstroke is recorded, every iteration is saved, and multiple artists 
            can contribute to the canvas.</p>
            
            <p>Whether you're building a personal project, contributing to open source, or working in a development team, the skills you'll learn today 
            will form the foundation of your collaborative coding practices. By the end of this session, you'll have created your first GitHub repository 
            and understood the key concepts that will enable you to work effectively with version control in your future projects.</p>

            <h3>Setting Up Your GitHub Account</h3>
            
            <h4>Creating a GitHub Account</h4>
            <p>Before creating a repository, you need a GitHub account. If you already have one, you can skip to the next section.</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Visit GitHub:</strong> Go to <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a></li>
                <li><strong>Sign up:</strong> Click the "Sign up" button and follow these steps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enter your email address</li>
                        <li>Create a password (use a strong, unique password)</li>
                        <li>Choose a username (this will be part of your repository URLs, so choose wisely)</li>
                        <li>Complete the verification puzzle</li>
                        <li>Click "Create account"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Verify your email:</strong> Check your inbox for a verification email from GitHub and click the verification link</li>
                <li><strong>Complete profile:</strong> Add a profile picture and basic information</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h4>Choosing a Good GitHub Username</h4>
            <p>Your GitHub username is an important part of your professional identity as a developer. Consider these tips when selecting a username:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Professional:</strong> Use a name you'd be comfortable sharing with employers</li>
                <li><strong>Recognizable:</strong> Ideally, it should be connected to your real name or consistent with your usernames on other platforms</li>
                <li><strong>Future-proof:</strong> Avoid trendy references that might feel dated in a few years</li>
                <li><strong>Concise:</strong> Shorter names are easier to remember and type</li>
                <li><strong>Unique:</strong> Distinguish yourself from others</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Remember that your GitHub profile will likely become part of your professional portfolio, so choose a username that represents you well.</p>
            
            <h4>Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h4>
            <p>Securing your GitHub account is crucial, especially as your repositories become more valuable. Two-factor authentication adds an extra 
            layer of security beyond just your password.</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Go to Settings:</strong> Click your profile picture in the top-right corner and select "Settings"</li>
                <li><strong>Find Security Options:</strong> In the left sidebar, click "Password and authentication"</li>
                <li><strong>Enable 2FA:</strong> Click "Enable two-factor authentication"</li>
                <li><strong>Choose a Method:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Authenticator app (recommended): Use apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator</li>
                        <li>SMS authentication: Receive codes via text message (less secure but better than no 2FA)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Save Recovery Codes:</strong> Store the provided recovery codes in a secure place</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Two-factor authentication protects your code and contributions from unauthorized access. As you build more repositories and contribute to more projects, this security becomes increasingly important.</p>

            <h3>Planning Your Repository</h3>
            
            <h4>Types of GitHub Repositories</h4>
            <p>Before creating a repository, it's helpful to understand the different types of repositories you might create:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Projects:</strong> Individual coding projects, experiments, or portfolio pieces</li>
                <li><strong>Open Source Contributions:</strong> Projects you want others to use, modify, and contribute to</li>
                <li><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Private or public repositories for working with teammates</li>
                <li><strong>Learning and Practice:</strong> Repositories for tutorials, courses, or practicing new skills</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Repositories primarily focused on guides, wikis, or educational content</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The purpose of your repository will influence how you structure it, what documentation you include, and which settings you choose.</p>
            
            <h4>Public vs. Private Repositories</h4>
            <p>GitHub offers both public and private repositories, each with its own advantages:</p>
            
            <table class="comparison-table">
                <tr>
                    <th>Public Repositories</th>
                    <th>Private Repositories</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Visible to everyone on the internet</td>
                    <td>Visible only to you and collaborators you invite</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Great for open-source projects</td>
                    <td>Suitable for proprietary code or personal experiments</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Showcases your work to potential employers</td>
                    <td>Keeps sensitive projects confidential</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Enables collaboration with the wider community</td>
                    <td>Limits collaboration to specific team members</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Free for unlimited repositories</td>
                    <td>Free for unlimited repositories (with limitations on features for free accounts)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <p>For learning purposes or personal projects you're proud of, public repositories are often the best choice. They allow others to see your work and potentially contribute, while helping you build a visible portfolio of your coding skills.</p>
            
            <h4>Repository Naming Conventions</h4>
            <p>A good repository name is clear, descriptive, and follows conventions that make it easy to understand. Consider these guidelines:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be descriptive:</strong> The name should indicate what the repository contains (e.g., "python-web-scraper" is better than "project1")</li>
                <li><strong>Use lowercase:</strong> Avoid capital letters to prevent confusion with case-sensitive systems</li>
                <li><strong>Use hyphens instead of spaces:</strong> Spaces in URLs get encoded as "%20", which is less readable (e.g., "machine-learning-examples")</li>
                <li><strong>Keep it concise:</strong> Aim for short but descriptive names</li>
                <li><strong>Be consistent:</strong> If you have multiple related repositories, use a consistent naming pattern</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Example naming patterns for different types of repositories:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Project repositories:</strong> "project-name"</li>
                <li><strong>Libraries/packages:</strong> "library-name"</li>
                <li><strong>Personal website:</strong> "username.github.io" (special format for GitHub Pages)</li>
                <li><strong>Course work:</strong> "course-name-project"</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> "project-docs" or "project-wiki"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>For this course, you might consider a name like "python-fullstack-portfolio" for a repository that will showcase your progress and projects.</p>

            <h3>Creating Your First Repository</h3>
            
            <h4>Step-by-Step Repository Creation</h4>
            <p>Now that you've planned your repository, let's create it on GitHub:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Sign in to GitHub:</strong> Log in to your GitHub account at <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a></li>
                
                <li><strong>Start the creation process:</strong> Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner of the page and select "New repository" from the dropdown menu</li>
                
                <li><strong>Fill in repository details:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Repository name:</strong> Enter a name following the conventions discussed earlier</li>
                        <li><strong>Description:</strong> Add a short, clear description of your repository (this will appear on your repository's page)</li>
                        <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Choose between Public or Private</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Initialize repository options:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Add a README file:</strong> Check this box to create an initial README.md file (highly recommended)</li>
                        <li><strong>Add .gitignore:</strong> Select a template based on your project type (e.g., Python)</li>
                        <li><strong>Choose a license:</strong> Select an appropriate license for your project</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Create repository:</strong> Click the "Create repository" button at the bottom of the page</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Congratulations! You've just created your first GitHub repository. You'll be redirected to your new repository's page, which includes the README.md file and other files you chose to initialize with.</p>
            
            <h4>Understanding Repository Initialization Options</h4>
            <p>Let's look more closely at the initialization options and why they're important:</p>
            
            <h5>README File</h5>
            <p>The README.md file is typically the first thing people see when they visit your repository. It serves as the welcome page and should explain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What your project does</li>
                <li>How to install and use it</li>
                <li>How to contribute (if it's a collaborative project)</li>
                <li>Any other important information about your project</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The .md extension stands for Markdown, a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text with simple syntax. GitHub automatically renders Markdown files as formatted HTML on your repository page.</p>
            
            <h5>.gitignore File</h5>
            <p>The .gitignore file tells Git which files or directories to ignore in your project. This is useful for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Build artifacts and compiled code</li>
                <li>Dependencies that can be reinstalled</li>
                <li>User-specific settings files</li>
                <li>Operating system files (like .DS_Store on macOS)</li>
                <li>Environment variables and secrets</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>GitHub offers templates for various programming languages and frameworks. For Python projects, the template includes patterns for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>__pycache__/ directories</li>
                <li>*.py[cod] files (compiled Python files)</li>
                <li>Virtual environment directories (venv/, ENV/)</li>
                <li>Distribution / packaging directories (dist/, build/)</li>
                <li>And many more Python-specific patterns</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>License File</h5>
            <p>The license defines how others can use, modify, and distribute your code. Common licenses include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MIT License:</strong> Very permissive, allows commercial use, modification, and distribution with minimal restrictions</li>
                <li><strong>GNU General Public License (GPL):</strong> Requires that derivative works also be open source</li>
                <li><strong>Apache License 2.0:</strong> Similar to MIT but with patent protections</li>
                <li><strong>No License:</strong> Without a license, default copyright laws apply, and others technically can't use your code</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>For learning projects or personal code you want others to use, the MIT License is often a good choice due to its simplicity and permissiveness.</p>
            
            <h4>Exploring Your New Repository</h4>
            <p>After creating your repository, take some time to explore its interface:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Code tab:</strong> Shows your files and their contents</li>
                <li><strong>Issues tab:</strong> For tracking tasks, enhancements, and bugs</li>
                <li><strong>Pull requests tab:</strong> For reviewing code changes before merging</li>
                <li><strong>Actions tab:</strong> For setting up automated workflows</li>
                <li><strong>Projects tab:</strong> For managing project boards</li>
                <li><strong>Wiki tab:</strong> For extended documentation</li>
                <li><strong>Security tab:</strong> For security settings and alerts</li>
                <li><strong>Insights tab:</strong> For analytics about your repository</li>
                <li><strong>Settings tab:</strong> For repository configuration</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This interface provides all the tools you need to manage your code, collaborate with others, and maintain your project over time.</p>

            <p>Markdown is a simple markup language that allows you to format text without HTML. Here are some common Markdown syntaxes:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <code>
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**Bold text**
*Italic text*

- Bullet point
- Another bullet point
  - Nested bullet point

1. Numbered item
2. Another numbered item

[Link text](https://www.example.com)

![Alt text for image](image-url.jpg)

`Inline code`

```python
# Code block
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

> Blockquote

| Table | Header |
|-------|--------|
| Cell  | Cell   |
| Cell  | Cell   |
                </code>
            </div>
            
            <p>Using Markdown effectively makes your documentation more readable and professional-looking. GitHub's editor includes a toolbar with Markdown formatting options to help you get started.</p>
            
            <h4>Repository Settings</h4>
            <p>Your repository has various settings that control its behavior and appearance. To access these:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Navigate to your repository</li>
                <li>Click the "Settings" tab near the top of the page</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Key settings to be aware of include:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Repository name:</strong> You can rename your repository if needed</li>
                <li><strong>Description and topics:</strong> Helps others find and understand your repository</li>
                <li><strong>Features:</strong> Enable or disable Wikis, Issues, Projects, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>GitHub Pages:</strong> Host a website directly from your repository</li>
                <li><strong>Branch protection rules:</strong> Control who can push to specific branches</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborators:</strong> Add other GitHub users who can contribute to your repository</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>For your first repository, the default settings are usually appropriate, but it's good to know where these options are for future projects.</p>

            <h3>Connecting Your Local Development Environment</h3>
            
            <h4>Cloning Your Repository Locally</h4>
            <p>While GitHub's web interface is useful for simple edits, most development work happens on your local machine. To get a local copy of your repository:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Navigate to your repository on GitHub</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Click the "Code" button:</strong> This opens a dropdown with clone options</li>
                <li><strong>Choose a clone method:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTTPS: Works through firewalls, but requires you to enter your password for pushes</li>
                        <li>SSH: More secure and allows passwordless pushing if you've set up SSH keys</li>
                        <li>GitHub CLI: If you have the GitHub CLI installed</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Copy the URL:</strong> Click the copy button next to the URL</li>
                <li><strong>Open your terminal or command prompt</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Navigate to where you want to clone the repository:</strong>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>$ cd path/to/desired/directory</code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Clone the repository:</strong>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git</code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Navigate into your cloned repository:</strong>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>$ cd your-repository</code>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Now you have a local copy of your repository that you can work with using your preferred code editor and development tools.</p>
            
            <h4>Making Changes Locally</h4>
            <p>Once you have a local clone, you can make changes to your files using any editor or IDE. Here's the basic workflow:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make changes to your files:</strong> Add code, modify files, create new files, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Stage changes:</strong> Mark the changes you want to include in your commit
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>$ git add filename.py</code>
                        <code>$ git add .</code>  <!-- Stage all changes -->
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Commit changes:</strong> Create a snapshot with a descriptive message
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>$ git commit -m "Add user authentication function"</code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Push changes to GitHub:</strong> Upload your local commits to your GitHub repository
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>$ git push origin main</code>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>After pushing, your changes will be visible on GitHub, and your local and remote repositories will be synchronized.</p>
            
            <h4>Setting Up Git for the First Time</h4>
            <p>If this is your first time using Git on your computer, you'll need to configure it with your identity. This information is used to attribute your commits.</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <code>$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code>
                <code>$ git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"</code>
            </div>
            
            <p>Use the same email address associated with your GitHub account to ensure your commits are properly linked to your GitHub profile.</p>
            
            <h4>Authentication Options</h4>
            <p>There are several ways to authenticate with GitHub when pushing changes:</p>
            
            <h5>HTTPS with Personal Access Token</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Generate a token:</strong> Go to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Generate new token</li>
                <li><strong>Set token scope:</strong> Select "repo" for full repository access</li>
                <li><strong>Use the token:</strong> When prompted for a password during git push, enter the token instead of your account password</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h5>SSH Key Authentication (Recommended)</h5>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Check for existing SSH keys:</strong>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>$ ls -la ~/.ssh</code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Generate new SSH key if needed:</strong>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"</code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Add SSH key to ssh-agent:</strong>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"</code>
                        <code>$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Add SSH key to GitHub account:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Copy the public key to clipboard:
                            <div class="code-example">
                                <code>$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code>
                                <!-- On Windows: clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub -->
                                <!-- On macOS: pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub -->
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>Go to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ SSH and GPG keys â†’ New SSH key</li>
                        <li>Paste your key and give it a descriptive title</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Test the connection:</strong>
                    <div class="code-example">
                        <code>$ ssh -T git@github.com</code>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>With SSH key authentication set up, you won't need to enter your password each time you push to GitHub.</p>

            <h3>Common Repository Patterns and Structures</h3>
            
            <h4>Basic Python Project Structure</h4>
            <p>For Python projects, it's helpful to follow a standardized directory structure. Here's a common pattern:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <code>
project_name/
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ setup.py
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ project_name/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.py
â””â”€â”€ tests/
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ test_main.py
    â””â”€â”€ test_utils.py
                </code>
            </div>
            
            <p>This structure separates your actual code (in the inner project_name directory) from project metadata and tests, making it clear and organized.</p>
            
            <h4>Web Application Structure</h4>
            <p>For web applications (like Flask or Django projects), the structure might look like this:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <code>
web_app/
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py
â”œâ”€â”€ static/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ css/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ js/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images/
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ base.html
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ home.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ about.html
â””â”€â”€ tests/
    â””â”€â”€ test_app.py
                </code>
            </div>
            
            <p>This organization separates static assets, templates, and application code, following web development best practices.</p>
            
            <h4>Documentation-Focused Repository</h4>
            <p>If your repository is primarily for documentation or course notes, consider a structure like this:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <code>
course_notes/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ week_1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lecture_notes.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ exercises.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resources.md
â”œâ”€â”€ week_2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lecture_notes.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ exercises.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resources.md
â””â”€â”€ projects/
    â”œâ”€â”€ project_1/
    â””â”€â”€ project_2/
                </code>
            </div>
            
            <p>This approach organizes content chronologically and by topic, making it easy to navigate.</p>
            
            <h4>Essential Files for Every Repository</h4>
            <p>Regardless of your project type, certain files should be included in almost every repository:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>README.md:</strong> Project overview, installation, and usage instructions</li>
                <li><strong>LICENSE:</strong> Terms under which your code can be used</li>
                <li><strong>.gitignore:</strong> Patterns for files Git should ignore</li>
                <li><strong>requirements.txt or setup.py:</strong> For Python projects, dependencies information</li>
                <li><strong>CONTRIBUTING.md:</strong> For collaborative projects, guidelines for contributors</li>
                <li><strong>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:</strong> For open-source projects, community behavior guidelines</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These files help others understand, use, and potentially contribute to your project.</p>
            
            <h4>Special Repository Types</h4>
            <p>GitHub has some special repository types with unique patterns:</p>
            
            <h5>GitHub Pages Personal Site</h5>
            <p>If you name a repository username.github.io, it will be published as a website at https://username.github.io.</p>
            
            <h5>Template Repositories</h5>
            <p>You can mark a repository as a template, allowing others to create new repositories with the same structure and files.</p>
            
            <h5>.github Repository</h5>
            <p>A special repository named .github can contain default files (like issue templates) that apply to all your other repositories.</p>

        <section class="best-practices">
            <h3>Best Practices for GitHub Repositories</h3>
            
            <h4>Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive README:</strong> Include all necessary information for users to understand and use your project</li>
                <li><strong>Code comments:</strong> Document your code with appropriate comments and docstrings</li>
                <li><strong>Wikis for complex projects:</strong> Use GitHub Wikis for detailed documentation that might clutter the README</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Provide usage examples to help users get started</li>
                <li><strong>Keep documentation updated:</strong> Ensure documentation reflects the current state of your project</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Commit Practices</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Atomic commits:</strong> Each commit should represent a single logical change</li>
                <li><strong>Descriptive commit messages:</strong> Clearly explain what the commit does and why</li>
                <li><strong>Consistent commit style:</strong> Consider using conventions like the Conventional Commits format (e.g., "feat: Add login button")</li>
                <li><strong>Regular commits:</strong> Commit frequently to create a detailed history and reduce the risk of losing work</li>
                <li><strong>Verify before committing:</strong> Review your changes with git diff before staging and committing</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Branch Management</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Main branch stability:</strong> Keep your main branch in a working state</li>
                <li><strong>Feature branches:</strong> Develop new features in dedicated branches</li>
                <li><strong>Delete merged branches:</strong> Clean up branches after they're merged to reduce clutter</li>
                <li><strong>Clear branch names:</strong> Use descriptive names that indicate purpose (e.g., "feature/login-system")</li>
                <li><strong>Protect important branches:</strong> Use branch protection rules for main/master branches</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Repository Maintenance</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep dependencies updated:</strong> Regularly update libraries and frameworks to address security vulnerabilities</li>
                <li><strong>Address issues promptly:</strong> Respond to bug reports and feature requests</li>
                <li><strong>Archive inactive repositories:</strong> Archive repositories that are no longer maintained</li>
                <li><strong>Use GitHub features:</strong> Take advantage of Issues, Projects, and Actions to manage your workflow</li>
                <li><strong>Review and refactor:</strong> Periodically review your codebase for opportunities to improve</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Security Practices</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Never commit secrets:</strong> Keep API keys, passwords, and tokens out of your repository</li>
                <li><strong>Use environment variables:</strong> Store sensitive information in environment variables or secure vaults</li>
                <li><strong>Enable security alerts:</strong> GitHub can notify you of vulnerabilities in your dependencies</li>
                <li><strong>Review access:</strong> Periodically review who has access to your repositories</li>
                <li><strong>License appropriately:</strong> Choose a license that matches your intentions for the code</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>GitHub Pages</h4>
            <p>GitHub Pages allows you to host websites directly from your GitHub repositories. This is perfect for project documentation, personal websites, or showcasing your portfolio.</p>
            
            <p>To enable GitHub Pages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to your repository's Settings</li>
                <li>Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section</li>
                <li>Select a source branch (usually main) and folder (/ or /docs)</li>
                <li>Click Save</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Your site will be published at https://username.github.io/repository-name/</p>
            
            <h4>GitHub Actions</h4>
            <p>GitHub Actions allow you to automate workflows directly in your GitHub repository. You can set up actions to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Run tests automatically when you push code</li>
                <li>Deploy your application when changes reach the main branch</li>
                <li>Publish packages to package registries</li>
                <li>Send notifications when certain events occur</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Actions are defined in YAML files in the .github/workflows directory.</p>
            
            <h4>GitHub Projects</h4>
            <p>GitHub Projects help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards with columns representing different stages of work (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) and move issues and pull requests between them.</p>
            
            <h4>GitHub Discussions</h4>
            <p>Discussions provide a forum-like space for questions, ideas, and conversations related to your repository. Unlike issues, which are typically focused on specific tasks or bugs, discussions are meant for broader topics and community engagement.</p>
            
            <h4>GitHub Codespaces</h4>
            <p>Codespaces are cloud-based development environments that allow you to code, build, test, and debug directly in your browser. They come with a web-based VS Code editor and a full development environment configured for your repository.</p>
