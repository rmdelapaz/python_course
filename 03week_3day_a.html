            <h2>Introduction to File I/O</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our deep dive into file handling with Python! Being able to read from and write to files is a foundational skill that unlocks countless possibilities in your programming journey. Think of files as containers of persistent data—unlike variables that disappear when your program ends, files remain on disk, ready to be accessed again later.</p>
            
            <p>File handling is like having a conversation with your computer's storage system. You open a communication channel, exchange information, and then politely close the connection when you're done. This conversation follows certain protocols and conventions that we'll explore today.</p>

            <h2>The File I/O Workflow: A Restaurant Analogy</h2>
            
            <p>Working with files in Python follows a pattern that's similar to dining at a restaurant:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Open the file</strong> - Like entering a restaurant and being seated at a table</li>
                <li><strong>Read or write data</strong> - Like ordering food (writing) or eating food (reading)</li>
                <li><strong>Close the file</strong> - Like paying the bill and leaving the restaurant</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Just as you wouldn't want to leave a restaurant without paying (causing problems for the restaurant), you don't want to leave files open when you're done with them (causing resource leaks in your system).</p>

            <div class="code-example">
                <h3>The Basic File Workflow</h3>
                <pre>
# Traditional approach (not recommended)
file = open('data/sample.txt', 'r')  # Open in read mode
content = file.read()               # Read the content
file.close()                        # Close the file (important!)

# The recommended approach using a context manager
with open('data/sample.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()           # Read the content
# File is automatically closed when the block ends

            <h2>File Opening Modes: The Access Permissions</h2>
            
            <p>When opening a file, you specify a mode that determines what operations are allowed. Think of these modes as different types of passes or tickets that grant different levels of access to a secure facility:</p>
            
            <table>
                <tr>

                    <td><code>'r'</code></td>
                    <td>Read (default) - Open for reading</td>
                    <td>Like a museum pass that lets you look but not touch exhibits</td>
                </tr>

                    <td><code>'w'</code></td>
                    <td>Write - Open for writing, creates file if it doesn't exist, truncates if it does</td>
                    <td>Like an editor who can completely rewrite a document</td>
                </tr>

                    <td><code>'a'</code></td>
                    <td>Append - Open for writing, creates file if it doesn't exist, adds to end if it does</td>
                    <td>Like a historian who can only add new entries to the end of a historical record</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>'r+'</code></td>
                    <td>Read and write - Open for both reading and writing</td>
                    <td>Like a book club member who can both read and write notes in the margins</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>'b'</code></td>
                    <td>Binary mode (added to other modes like <code>'rb'</code> or <code>'wb'</code>)</td>
                    <td>Like switching from reading text to reading blueprints or technical diagrams</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>'t'</code></td>
                    <td>Text mode (default, can be added like <code>'rt'</code> or <code>'wt'</code>)</td>
                    <td>Like reading a book in your native language</td>
                </tr>

            <h2>Reading Text Files: The Art of Information Extraction</h2>
            
            <p>Reading files is like extracting information from a book. Python gives you several ways to read, from consuming the whole book at once to reading it chapter by chapter, or even line by line.</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <h3>Reading an Entire File at Once</h3>

            </div>
            
            <p>Reading the entire file is convenient for small files, but for larger files, it's like trying to eat an entire meal in one bite—not always the best approach!</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <h3>Reading Line by Line</h3>
                <pre>

        # Process each line
        print(f"Line: {line.strip()}")  # strip() removes the newline character

            </div>
            
            <p>Reading line by line is like eating a meal one bite at a time—much more manageable for larger files and often exactly what you need for text processing.</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <h3>Reading Lines into a List</h3>

            <h2>Writing Text Files: Creating Digital Footprints</h2>
            
            <p>Writing to files is like creating or modifying a document. You can start fresh with a blank page, add to an existing document, or completely replace its contents.</p>

            <h2>The Context Manager Pattern: Python's File Safety Net</h2>
            
            <p>We've been using the <code>with</code> statement in our examples, which implements what's called a "context manager" pattern. Think of this as Python's automatic safety system for working with files.</p>
            
            <div class="comparison">
                <h3>Without a Context Manager (Risky)</h3>
                <pre>
# File: examples/without_context.py
try:
    file = open('data/sample.txt', 'r')
    content = file.read()
    # What if an exception happens here?
    # The file might never get closed!
finally:
    file.close()  # We need to ensure this happens
                </pre>
                
                <h3>With a Context Manager (Safe)</h3>
                <pre>
# File: examples/with_context.py
with open('data/sample.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    # Even if an exception occurs, the file will be closed automatically
                </pre>
            </div>
            
            <p>Using <code>with</code> is like having a responsible friend who always makes sure the lights are turned off and the door is locked when you leave a room, even if you're in a hurry or get distracted.</p>
            
            <div class="practical-tip">
                <h3>Practical Tip: Always Use Context Managers</h3>
                <p>Always use the <code>with</code> statement when working with files. It guarantees that files are properly closed, even when exceptions occur. This prevents resource leaks and potential data corruption.</p>

            <h2>File Pointers: Navigating Through Files</h2>
            
            <p>When you're reading from or writing to a file, Python keeps track of your position with an internal pointer or cursor. Think of this like a bookmark in a book—it remembers where you left off.</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">

    # Read the first 10 characters
    part1 = file.read(10)
    print(f"First 10 characters: {part1}")
    
    # Check the current position
    position = file.tell()
    print(f"Current position: {position}")
    
    # Read the next 10 characters
    part2 = file.read(10)
    print(f"Next 10 characters: {part2}")
    
    # Move back to the beginning
    file.seek(0)
    print(f"After seek(0), first 5 characters: {file.read(5)}")

            </div>

            <p>Working with files involves the outside world, which means many things can go wrong: files might not exist, permissions might be insufficient, disks might be full. Good code anticipates these issues.</p>

            <h2>Handling File Paths: The Location Navigation Challenge</h2>
            
            <p>One common challenge in file I/O is dealing with file paths correctly across different operating systems. Python provides the <code>os.path</code> and newer <code>pathlib</code> modules to help with this.</p>

# Split a path into directory and filename

            <h2>Character Encodings: The Language of Text Files</h2>
            
            <p>Text files store characters as bytes, and the way those bytes are interpreted depends on the encoding. Think of encodings as different languages for computers—the same bytes might mean different things in different encodings.</p>

                <h3>Practical Tip: Stick with UTF-8</h3>

                    <li><strong>Use appropriate modules</strong> for specific file formats (e.g., <code>csv</code> for CSV files, <code>json</code> for JSON).</li>
                    <li><strong>Check if a file exists before opening</strong> it to avoid unexpected errors.</li>
