            <h3>What is Responsive Web Design?</h3>
            <p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. It's like having a single piece of clothing that automatically adjusts to fit whoever wears it perfectly, regardless of their size or shape.</p>
            
            <p>In the early days of the web, sites were built with fixed dimensions, typically optimized for desktop monitors. With the explosion of mobile devices, this approach became unsustainable. Imagine trying to read a newspaper through a keyhole – that's essentially what browsing a desktop site on a mobile phone was like before responsive design.</p>
            
            <p>Today, we build websites that respond and adapt to the environment they're viewed in. This is not just a technical necessity, but a user experience imperative.</p>

            <h3>Core Principles of Responsive Design</h3>
            
            <div class="principle">
                <h4>Fluid Layouts</h4>
                <p>Think of fluid layouts like water - they take the shape of their container. Instead of fixed pixel widths (like 960px), we use relative units like percentages to allow content to expand and contract based on the viewport size.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of setting a container to a fixed width:</p>
                <pre><code>.container {
    width: 960px;
}</code></pre>
                
                <p>We make it fluid by using percentages:</p>
                <pre><code>.container {
    width: 90%;
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}</code></pre>
                
                <p><strong>Real-world analogy:</strong> It's like a water balloon that maintains its integrity but changes shape based on how you hold it.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="principle">
                <h4>Flexible Images and Media</h4>
                <p>Media elements need to scale within their containers to avoid overflow or unwanted scrollbars.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> The classic responsive image CSS:</p>
                <pre><code>img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}</code></pre>
                
                <p>This simple rule ensures images never exceed their container width but scale down when needed.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Real-world analogy:</strong> Think of responsive images like a photograph in a resizable frame - the frame changes size, and the photo maintains its proportions while filling the available space.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="principle">
                <h4>Media Queries</h4>
                <p>Media queries act as conditional statements for applying different CSS based on device characteristics, primarily screen width.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Changing layout at different screen sizes:</p>
                <pre><code>/* Base styles for all devices */
.card-container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}

/* For tablets and larger (768px and up) */
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    .card-container {
        flex-direction: row;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
    }
    .card {
        width: 48%;
        margin: 1%;
    }
}

/* For desktops (1024px and up) */
@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {
    .card {
        width: 31.333%;
        margin: 1%;
    }
}</code></pre>
                
                <p><strong>Real-world analogy:</strong> Media queries are like weather-responsive clothing - think of a jacket that automatically adds or removes layers based on the temperature outside.</p>
            </div>

        <section class="historical_context">
            <h3>Historical Context and Evolution</h3>
            <p>Responsive Web Design was formally introduced by Ethan Marcotte in his 2010 article for A List Apart. Before this, we had separate mobile sites (often with "m." subdomains), which created maintenance problems and inconsistent experiences.</p>
            
            <p>Patterns of web usage have dramatically shifted. In 2010, mobile accounted for less than 5% of global web traffic. Today, mobile devices generate more than half of all website traffic worldwide.</p>
            
            <p>This isn't just a technical evolution but a fundamental shift in how we approach design - from designing for specific screen sizes to designing for content flexibility across a continuum of possible screen dimensions.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="viewport_configuration">
            <h3>Viewport Configuration</h3>
            <p>The viewport meta tag is the foundation of responsive design. Without it, mobile browsers would render pages at desktop widths and scale them down, making text unreadable and interactions frustrating.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> The standard viewport meta tag:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code></pre>
            
            <p>This crucial line tells mobile browsers to set the viewport width to the device width and establish a 1:1 scaling ratio, preventing automatic zooming.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Breaking down the components:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>width=device-width</code>: Sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device</li>
                <li><code>initial-scale=1.0</code>: Sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded</li>
                <li><code>maximum-scale=1.0</code> (optional, but use cautiously): Prevents zooming, which can harm accessibility</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Real-world analogy:</strong> The viewport meta tag is like adjusting a telescope's focus - without proper adjustment, everything appears distant and hard to read.</p>

        <section class="mobile_first">
            <h3>Mobile-First Approach</h3>
            <p>Mobile-first design is a design philosophy that advocates starting the design process from the smallest screen and working your way up to larger screens. This is the opposite of the traditional approach where desktop designs came first.</p>
            
            <h4>Why Mobile-First Matters</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Discipline in content prioritization</strong>: When you have limited screen real estate, you must decide what truly matters.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance benefits</strong>: Mobile devices often have less processing power and slower connections.</li>
                <li><strong>Progressive enhancement</strong>: Start with a solid base experience and enhance it for more capable devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Future-proofing</strong>: As more users move to mobile, starting with mobile ensures your core experience works well on these devices.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>In CSS practice, mobile-first means:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>/* Base styles for mobile devices */
.container {
    padding: 10px;
}

/* Enhance for tablets */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .container {
        padding: 20px;
    }
}

/* Enhance for desktops */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
    .container {
        padding: 30px;
        max-width: 1200px;
        margin: 0 auto;
    }
}</code></pre>
            
            <p>Notice how we start with base styles for all devices (which will be applied to mobile by default) and then progressively add enhancements for larger screens.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Real-world analogy:</strong> Mobile-first design is like packing for a trip starting with a small backpack. You prioritize the essentials first, then add more items as you move to a larger suitcase. This ensures you always have what's truly important.</p>

        <section class="common_breakpoints">
            <h3>Common Breakpoints and Device Considerations</h3>
            <p>Breakpoints are the screen widths at which your layout changes. While traditionally tied to device categories, modern responsive design focuses on content-based breakpoints rather than specific devices.</p>
            
            <p>However, these common dimensions are useful starting points:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Small phones</strong>: 320px - 480px</li>
                <li><strong>Large phones/Small tablets</strong>: 481px - 767px</li>
                <li><strong>Tablets</strong>: 768px - 1023px</li>
                <li><strong>Laptops/Desktops</strong>: 1024px - 1199px</li>
                <li><strong>Large screens</strong>: 1200px and above</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Example of content-based breakpoints:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>/* Base styles first */
.product-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    gap: 20px;
}

/* When there's enough space for two products side by side */
@media (min-width: 600px) {
    .product-grid {
        grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    }
}

/* When there's enough space for three products side by side */
@media (min-width: 900px) {
    .product-grid {
        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    }
}

/* When there's enough space for four products side by side */
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
    .product-grid {
        grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    }
}</code></pre>
            
            <p>Instead of targeting specific devices, we're considering when our content (product cards) would benefit from a layout change.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Real-world analogy:</strong> Think of breakpoints like thresholds in a growing room. Just as you might add an extra bed when a room reaches a certain size, you adjust your layout when the screen reaches a size where the current layout becomes awkward.</p>

            <h3>Practical Application: Building a Responsive Card Layout</h3>
            <p>Let's put these principles into practice by creating a responsive card layout that works well across all devices.</p>
            
            <h4>HTML Structure</h4>
            <pre><code>&lt;div class="card-container"&gt;
    &lt;article class="card"&gt;
        &lt;img src="image1.jpg" alt="Card image"&gt;
        &lt;div class="card-content"&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Card Title 1&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is the description for card 1, providing additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;a href="#" class="btn"&gt;Learn More&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;
    
    &lt;article class="card"&gt;
        &lt;img src="image2.jpg" alt="Card image"&gt;
        &lt;div class="card-content"&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Card Title 2&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is the description for card 2, providing additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;a href="#" class="btn"&gt;Learn More&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;
    
    &lt;article class="card"&gt;
        &lt;img src="image3.jpg" alt="Card image"&gt;
        &lt;div class="card-content"&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Card Title 3&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is the description for card 3, providing additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;a href="#" class="btn"&gt;Learn More&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
            
            <h4>CSS with Mobile-First Approach</h4>
            <pre><code>/* Base styles (mobile first) */
.card-container {
    padding: 15px;
}

.card {
    background-color: #fff;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    overflow: hidden; /* Ensures the image doesn't break the card's border radius */
}

.card img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    display: block;
}

.card-content {
    padding: 15px;
}

.card-content h3 {
    margin-top: 0;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
}

.btn {
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: #0066cc;
    color: white;
    padding: 8px 16px;
    text-decoration: none;
    border-radius: 4px;
    font-weight: bold;
}

/* Tablet styles */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .card-container {
        display: flex;
        flex-wrap: wrap;
        gap: 20px;
    }
    
    .card {
        flex: 0 0 calc(50% - 20px); /* Two cards per row with gap */
        margin-bottom: 0;
    }
    
    .card-content h3 {
        font-size: 1.3rem;
    }
}

/* Desktop styles */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
    .card-container {
        max-width: 1200px;
        margin: 0 auto;
    }
    
    .card {
        flex: 0 0 calc(33.333% - 20px); /* Three cards per row with gap */
    }
    
    .card-content {
        padding: 20px;
    }
    
    .card-content h3 {
        font-size: 1.5rem;
    }
}</code></pre>
            
            <p>This example demonstrates several responsive principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We start with a simple stacked layout for mobile devices</li>
                <li>As screen size increases, we transition to a multi-column layout</li>
                <li>We use flexible units to ensure the layout works at any screen size</li>
                <li>Text size and spacing increase progressively for larger screens</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> This pattern is used extensively in e-commerce product listings, blog post lists, news sites, and portfolio displays. It efficiently organizes content while maximizing screen real estate at various sizes.</p>

            <h3>Testing Responsive Designs</h3>
            <p>Designing responsively is only half the battle - thorough testing across devices is essential.</p>
            
            <h4>Testing Methods</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Browser Developer Tools</strong>: Both Chrome and Firefox offer robust device emulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Actual Devices</strong>: Nothing beats testing on real hardware when possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Testing Services</strong>: Tools like BrowserStack allow testing across multiple devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Design Mode</strong>: Firefox's responsive design mode allows custom viewport sizes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>What to Test</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Layout integrity</strong>: Does everything stay properly contained?</li>
                <li><strong>Text readability</strong>: Is font size appropriate at all screen sizes?</li>
                <li><strong>Touch targets</strong>: Are buttons and links easy to tap on mobile (minimum 44×44 pixels)?</li>
                <li><strong>Image scaling</strong>: Do images load properly and maintain quality?</li>
                <li><strong>Load time</strong>: Performance can vary dramatically by device and connection.</li>
                <li><strong>Orientation changes</strong>: Does the site work well in both portrait and landscape?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Real-world analogy:</strong> Testing responsive designs is like trying on clothes in different lighting conditions and positions. Something might look great standing up in the store's flattering light but look completely different when you sit down in natural light.</p>

        <section class="common_patterns">
            <h3>Common Responsive Design Patterns</h3>
            
            <div class="pattern">
                <h4>Mostly Fluid</h4>
                <p>The mostly fluid pattern consists primarily of a fluid grid that remains the same at smaller screen sizes but adjusts to a multi-column layout for larger screens.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Many news websites like The Guardian use this pattern, starting with a single column on mobile and expanding to multiple columns as space allows.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="pattern">
                <h4>Column Drop</h4>
                <p>In the column drop pattern, multi-column layouts stack vertically as the window width narrows and screen size can no longer support the content.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> The CNN website uses this approach, with sidebar content moving below the main content on mobile devices.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="pattern">
                <h4>Layout Shifter</h4>
                <p>The layout shifter pattern is the most responsive pattern, with multiple breakpoints across different screen widths and changes in layout specific to each breakpoint.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> The Stripe.com website completely reshuffles content and navigation based on screen size.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="pattern">
                <h4>Off Canvas</h4>
                <p>The off canvas pattern places less frequently used content (like navigation) off-screen, showing it only when the screen is large enough, or when triggered by the user (like a hamburger menu).</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world example:</strong> Almost every mobile app and many websites like Facebook use off-canvas navigation on smaller screens.</p>
            </div>

        <section class="best_practices">
            <h3>Responsive Design Best Practices</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start with mobile</strong>: It's easier to add complexity than to remove it.</li>
                <li><strong>Use relative units</strong>: Prefer percentages, em, rem, vh, and vw over fixed pixels.</li>
                <li><strong>Test on real devices</strong>: Emulators are helpful but can't replace real-world testing.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider performance</strong>: Mobile users often have bandwidth constraints and less powerful devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimize images</strong>: Use modern formats like WebP and appropriate sizes for different viewports.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't hide content</strong>: Instead of hiding content on mobile, prioritize it differently.</li>
                <li><strong>Mind your touch targets</strong>: Make sure clickable elements are at least 44×44 pixels on mobile.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider different input methods</strong>: Users might be using touch, mouse, keyboard, or voice.</li>
                <li><strong>Use feature queries</strong>: <code>@supports</code> allows you to test for feature support before using it.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Example of Feature Queries</h4>
            <pre><code>/* Base layout for all browsers */
.container {
    display: block;
}

/* Enhanced layout for browsers that support CSS Grid */
@supports (display: grid) {
    .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));
        gap: 20px;
    }
}</code></pre>
            
            <p>This approach ensures that even older browsers get a functional experience while newer browsers receive an enhanced version.</p>

                <p>While media queries are based on viewport size, container queries respond to the size of a parent element. This allows components to adapt based on their container, not just the screen size.</p>
                <p><strong>Example</strong> (experimental feature):</p>
                <pre><code>@container (min-width: 400px) {
    .card {
        display: flex;
    }
    
    .card-image {
        flex: 0 0 40%;
    }
}</code></pre>
                <p>This would make the card component display as a flex container only when its container is at least 400px wide.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="trend">
                <h4>Fluid Typography</h4>
                <p>Using viewport units and calc() function to create text that scales smoothly between viewport sizes:</p>
                <pre><code>h1 {
    font-size: calc(1.5rem + 2vw);
}</code></pre>
                <p>This creates headings that scale proportionally with the viewport but maintain minimum and maximum sizes.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="trend">
                <h4>Variable Fonts</h4>
                <p>A single font file containing multiple variations of a typeface, allowing designers to fine-tune typography for different screen sizes while minimizing download sizes.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: The Importance of Responsive Design</h3>
            <p>Responsive design isn't just a technical solution; it's a user-centered approach to creating websites that work for everyone, regardless of how they access the web. As device diversity continues to increase—from watches to wall-sized displays—the principles of responsive design become even more crucial.</p>
            
            <p>Remember that responsive design is about more than just making things "fit" on different screens. It's about creating intuitive, accessible experiences that feel natural on any device. Your content should feel at home wherever it's viewed, like a chameleon comfortably adapting to its environment.</p>
            
            <p>In our next session, we'll dive deeper into specific responsive technologies: CSS Flexbox and Grid, which provide powerful tools for creating flexible layouts with minimal code.</p>
