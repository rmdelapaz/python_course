            <h2>Introduction to CSS Grid</h2>
            <p>CSS Grid Layout is a revolutionary two-dimensional layout system designed specifically for the web. While Flexbox gives us powerful tools for one-dimensional layouts (either rows OR columns), Grid allows us to work with both rows AND columns simultaneously.</p>
            
            <p>Think of CSS Grid as a digital spreadsheet for your webpage—it creates a framework where elements can be precisely positioned both horizontally and vertically. Just as a city planner uses a grid system to organize buildings, streets, and public spaces, CSS Grid helps us organize content in a structured, yet flexible manner.</p>

        <section class="why-grid">
            <h2>Why Learn CSS Grid?</h2>
            <p>Before CSS Grid, creating complex layouts required intricate combinations of floats, positioning, and various hacks. It was like trying to build a skyscraper with materials meant for a single-story house—possible, but unnecessarily complex.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>True Two-Dimensional Layout:</strong> Unlike previous methods, Grid handles both columns and rows simultaneously.</li>
                <li><strong>Simplified Code:</strong> Achieve complex layouts with fewer, more intuitive lines of CSS.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Create layouts that adapt gracefully to different screen sizes without relying on media queries for every change.</li>
                <li><strong>Grid Template Areas:</strong> Name sections of your layout for easy reorganization, like having labeled boxes when moving house.</li>
                <li><strong>Industry Standard:</strong> Grid is now supported by all major browsers and has become an essential skill for modern web developers.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In real-world applications, CSS Grid shines when building dashboards, photo galleries, news websites, card layouts, and product catalogs—anywhere you need to organize content in rows and columns with precision.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="grid-vs-flexbox">
            <h2>Grid vs. Flexbox: When to Use Each</h2>
            <p>Think of Flexbox and Grid as different tools in your toolbox. A hammer and a screwdriver both join things together, but they serve different purposes.</p>
            
            <h3>Use Flexbox when:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You need to arrange items in a single row or column</li>
                <li>You want content to dictate layout (content-first design)</li>
                <li>You're aligning elements within a container</li>
                <li>Example: Navigation menus, button groups, centering content</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Use Grid when:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You need to control both rows and columns</li>
                <li>You want layout to dictate content placement (layout-first design)</li>
                <li>You're creating overall page structures</li>
                <li>Example: Page layouts, complex card arrangements, image galleries</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The best web developers often combine both: Grid for the overall layout structure, and Flexbox for component arrangement within Grid cells—similar to how city planners use grid systems for neighborhoods but allow flexibility in how individual buildings are designed.</p>

        <section class="grid-terminology">
            <h2>Essential Grid Terminology</h2>
            <p>Before diving into code, let's understand the key concepts, much like learning the parts of speech before writing sentences:</p>
            
            <dl>
                <dt>Grid Container</dt>
                <dd>The element with <code>display: grid</code> applied to it. Like the foundation of a building.</dd>
                
                <dt>Grid Item</dt>
                <dd>Direct children of the grid container. These are the rooms in your building.</dd>
                
                <dt>Grid Line</dt>
                <dd>The dividing lines that make up the grid structure. Like the walls between rooms.</dd>
                
                <dt>Grid Track</dt>
                <dd>The space between two adjacent grid lines (columns or rows). Think of hallways running through your building.</dd>
                
                <dt>Grid Cell</dt>
                <dd>The intersection of a row and column. A single "unit" of your grid, like an individual room.</dd>
                
                <dt>Grid Area</dt>
                <dd>Multiple grid cells that form a rectangle. Like combining several rooms to make a larger space.</dd>
            </dl>
            
            <p>Understanding these terms is crucial for effective communication about Grid layouts, just as architects need common terminology to discuss building plans.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="basic-grid">
            <h2>Creating Your First Grid</h2>
            <p>Let's create a basic grid to see how it works. Think of this as building your first small structure:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <h3>HTML Structure</h3>
                <pre><code>&lt;div class="container"&gt;
    &lt;div class="item"&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="item"&gt;2&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="item"&gt;3&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="item"&gt;4&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="item"&gt;5&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="item"&gt;6&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <pre><code>.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px;
    grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
    gap: 10px;
}

.item {
    background-color: #3498db;
    color: white;
    padding: 20px;
    font-size: 30px;
    text-align: center;
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <p>This creates a 3×2 grid (3 columns, 2 rows) with specific sizes and gaps between items—similar to planning a simple 6-room building with consistent room sizes and hallways between them.</p>

            <p>What's happening here?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>display: grid</code> activates CSS Grid on the container</li>
                <li><code>grid-template-columns</code> defines three columns, each 200px wide</li>
                <li><code>grid-template-rows</code> defines two rows, each 100px tall</li>
                <li><code>gap</code> (shorthand for <code>row-gap</code> and <code>column-gap</code>) creates spacing between grid items</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="fr-unit">
            <h2>The Powerful fr Unit</h2>
            <p>The <code>fr</code> unit is one of Grid's most powerful features. It represents a fraction of the available space in the grid container. Think of it like dividing inheritance among siblings—each gets a share proportional to their assigned fraction.</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <pre><code>.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 100px 200px;
    gap: 10px;
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <p>In this example, the second column takes up twice as much space as the first and third columns. If our container is 900px wide and we have a 10px gap between columns, the columns would be approximately 220px, 440px, and 220px wide.</p>
            
            <p>The <code>fr</code> unit is particularly valuable for responsive design. Unlike pixels, percentages, or other fixed units, <code>fr</code> adapts to the available space. It's like having rooms that automatically resize as the building expands or contracts.</p>
            
            <h3>Real-world application:</h3>
            <p>News websites often use this pattern, with a narrow sidebar for navigation (1fr), a wide central content area (2fr), and another sidebar for ads or related content (1fr).</p>
        </section>

        <section class="responsive-grid">
            <h2>Building Responsive Grids</h2>
            <p>CSS Grid truly shines when creating responsive layouts. Let's explore several techniques:</p>
            
            <h3>Using minmax()</h3>
            <p>The <code>minmax()</code> function sets a minimum and maximum size for grid tracks. It's like setting the bounds for how small or large a room can be:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <pre><code>.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(200px, 1fr));
    gap: 20px;
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <p>This creates three columns that are each at least 200px wide but can expand to share the available space. It's particularly useful for ensuring readability on smaller screens while allowing content to breathe on larger ones.</p>
            
            <h3>Using auto-fill and auto-fit</h3>
            <p>These keywords allow you to automatically create as many columns as will fit in the container:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <pre><code>/* Creates as many 200px columns as possible */
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
    gap: 20px;
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <p>The difference between <code>auto-fill</code> and <code>auto-fit</code> is subtle but important:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>auto-fill</code> creates as many columns as can fit, including empty ones</li>
                <li><code>auto-fit</code> creates as many columns as needed and expands them to fill the available space</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Think of <code>auto-fill</code> as reserving space for potential future rooms, while <code>auto-fit</code> expands existing rooms to use all available space.</p>
            
            <h3>Real-world application:</h3>
            <p>E-commerce product grids often use this pattern. On mobile, you might see one product per row, on tablets two or three, and on desktops four or more—all with the same CSS, no media queries required.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="grid-placement">
            <h2>Grid Placement</h2>
            <p>Grid allows precise control over where items are placed within the grid. This is like being able to specify exactly which room a piece of furniture goes in.</p>
            
            <h3>Line-based Placement</h3>
            <p>You can place items based on grid line numbers:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <pre><code>.special-item {
    grid-column-start: 1;
    grid-column-end: 3;
    grid-row-start: 1;
    grid-row-end: 2;
}

/* Shorthand */
.special-item {
    grid-column: 1 / 3;
    grid-row: 1 / 2;
}

/* Even shorter using span */
.special-item {
    grid-column: 1 / span 2;
    grid-row: 1;
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <p>This places the item from column line 1 to column line 3 (spanning 2 columns) and in the first row. It's like specifying that a particular exhibit in a museum should take up rooms 1 and 2 on the first floor.</p>
            
            <h3>The grid-area Shorthand</h3>
            <p>An even more concise way to specify placement:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <pre><code>.special-item {
    /* grid-row-start / grid-column-start / grid-row-end / grid-column-end */
    grid-area: 1 / 1 / 2 / 3;
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <p>While powerful, the order can be confusing to remember. Think of it clockwise from the top: top, right, bottom, left (similar to how CSS padding and margin work).</p>
        </section>

        <section class="named-areas">
            <h2>Named Grid Areas</h2>
            <p>One of Grid's most intuitive features is the ability to name areas of your grid. This is like having a building floor plan with labeled rooms:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <pre><code>.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
    grid-template-areas: 
        "header header header"
        "sidebar-1 main sidebar-2"
        "footer footer footer";
    min-height: 100vh;
}

.header { grid-area: header; }
.main { grid-area: main; }
.sidebar-1 { grid-area: sidebar-1; }
.sidebar-2 { grid-area: sidebar-2; }
.footer { grid-area: footer; }</code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <p>This creates a classic website layout with a header spanning all columns at the top, a main content area flanked by two sidebars in the middle, and a footer spanning all columns at the bottom.</p>
            
            <p>The beauty of named areas is that they make the layout structure visually apparent in the code. It's also incredibly easy to rearrange the layout for different screen sizes:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <pre><code>@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .container {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr;
        grid-template-areas: 
            "header"
            "main"
            "sidebar-1"
            "sidebar-2"
            "footer";
    }
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <p>With just a few lines of code, we've completely transformed the layout for smaller screens—like rearranging rooms in a modular building.</p>
            
            <h3>Real-world application:</h3>
            <p>Dashboard interfaces often use named grid areas to create complex layouts that need to reorganize significantly across different device sizes.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="alignment">
            <h2>Grid Alignment</h2>
            <p>CSS Grid provides powerful alignment capabilities for both the grid items within their cells and the grid itself within its container:</p>
            
            <h3>Aligning Items Within Their Cells</h3>
            <p>You can control how items are aligned inside their grid cells:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <pre><code>.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    /* Align all items in their cells */
    justify-items: center; /* horizontal alignment */
    align-items: center;   /* vertical alignment */
}

/* For individual item alignment */
.special-item {
    justify-self: end;   /* right-aligned */
    align-self: start;   /* top-aligned */
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <p>This is similar to how you might position furniture within rooms—centered, against walls, etc.</p>
            
            <h3>Aligning the Grid Within Its Container</h3>
            <p>You can also control how the entire grid is positioned if it doesn't fill its container:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <pre><code>.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 100px);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px);
    height: 500px; /* Container is taller than the grid */
    justify-content: center; /* Center the grid horizontally */
    align-content: start;    /* Align the grid to the top */
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <p>This is like deciding where to position a building on a plot of land that's larger than the building itself.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="practical-example">
            <h2>Practical Example: Building a Photo Gallery</h2>
            <p>Let's apply what we've learned to create a responsive photo gallery—a common real-world application of CSS Grid:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <pre><code>&lt;div class="gallery"&gt;
    &lt;img src="image1.jpg" alt="Description 1" class="gallery-item"&gt;
    &lt;img src="image2.jpg" alt="Description 2" class="gallery-item featured"&gt;
    &lt;img src="image3.jpg" alt="Description 3" class="gallery-item"&gt;
    &lt;img src="image4.jpg" alt="Description 4" class="gallery-item"&gt;
    &lt;img src="image5.jpg" alt="Description 5" class="gallery-item"&gt;
    &lt;img src="image6.jpg" alt="Description 6" class="gallery-item"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <pre><code>.gallery {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));
    grid-auto-rows: 200px;
    gap: 15px;
    padding: 15px;
}

.gallery-item {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    object-fit: cover; /* Ensures images maintain aspect ratio while filling space */
    border-radius: 4px;
    transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.gallery-item:hover {
    transform: scale(1.05);
}

.featured {
    grid-column: span 2;
    grid-row: span 2;
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <p>This creates a responsive gallery where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Images automatically arrange themselves based on available space</li>
                <li>Each image is at least 250px wide but will grow to fill available space</li>
                <li>All rows are 200px tall</li>
                <li>The "featured" image spans two columns and two rows</li>
                <li>Images scale slightly when hovered over for a subtle interactive effect</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This gallery will work beautifully across device sizes without additional media queries. On smaller screens, it might show one column of images, while larger screens could display four or more columns—all from the same CSS.</p>

        <section class="python-integration">
            <h2>Integrating With Python Web Applications</h2>
            <p>As Python developers, you'll often need to generate grid layouts dynamically based on data from your backend. Here's how you might use Grid in a Flask or Django application:</p>
            
            <h3>Example: Dynamic Product Grid in Flask with Jinja2</h3>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <h4>Flask Route</h4>
                <pre><code>@app.route('/products')
def products():
    # Fetch products from database
    products = Product.query.all()
    return render_template('products.html', products=products)</code></pre>

                <h4>Jinja2 Template (products.html)</h4>
                <pre><code>&lt;div class="product-grid"&gt;
    {% for product in products %}
        &lt;div class="product-card {% if product.featured %}featured{% endif %}"&gt;
            &lt;img src="{{ product.image_url }}" alt="{{ product.name }}"&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;{{ product.name }}&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;p class="price"&gt;{{ product.price }}&lt;/p&gt;

                <h4>CSS</h4>
                <pre><code>.product-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
    gap: 20px;
    padding: 20px;

.product-card {
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    border-radius: 8px;

            <p>This example demonstrates how Grid works seamlessly with dynamically generated content from your Python backend. The template loop creates cards for each product, and CSS Grid automatically arranges them in a responsive layout. Featured products span two columns for emphasis.</p>
            
            <p>In your Python web applications, you can use similar patterns to create:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dashboard layouts with dynamically populated widgets</li>
                <li>Content management systems with flexible content areas</li>
                <li>Photo galleries generated from database records</li>
                <li>News or blog layouts with featured articles</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="browser-support">
            <h2>Browser Support and Fallbacks</h2>
            <p>CSS Grid is now supported by all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). However, if you need to support very old browsers, consider using feature detection:</p>
            
            <div class="code-example">
                <pre><code>@supports (display: grid) {
    .container {
        display: grid;
        /* Grid properties */
    }
}

/* Fallback for browsers that don't support Grid */
.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.container > * {
    width: 30%; /* Fallback width */
    margin: 1.66%;
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <p>This approach provides a simpler flexbox-based layout for older browsers while delivering the full Grid experience to modern browsers—similar to how architects might include both stairs and elevators in a building design.</p>

        <section class="troubleshooting">
            <h2>Common Grid Pitfalls and Troubleshooting</h2>
            <p>As you work with Grid, watch out for these common issues:</p>
            
            <h3>Why isn't my grid working?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forgetting to set display: grid:</strong> The container must have this property to activate Grid.</li>
                <li><strong>Nesting issues:</strong> Only direct children of the grid container become grid items.</li>
                <li><strong>Counting grid lines incorrectly:</strong> Remember that line numbering starts at 1, not 0.</li>
                <li><strong>Confusion with fr units:</strong> They divide free space after fixed-width elements are accounted for.</li>
                <li><strong>Implicit vs. explicit grid:</strong> Items placed outside your defined grid create an implicit grid.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Debugging Techniques</h3>
            <p>When troubleshooting Grid layouts:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Use browser DevTools to inspect the grid (most browsers have grid visualization tools)</li>
                <li>Temporarily add background colors to grid items to see their boundaries</li>
                <li>Verify that your HTML structure matches your expected grid structure</li>
                <li>Check for conflicting positioning properties</li>
            </ol>
