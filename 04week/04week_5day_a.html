            <h2>Introduction to Developer Tools</h2>
            <p>Developer tools are to web developers what a surgical toolkit is to a surgeon. Just as a surgeon needs specialized instruments to perform intricate operations, web developers need sophisticated tools to dissect, diagnose, and enhance websites. These built-in browser tools transform your browser from a passive viewing application into an active development environment.</p>
            
            <p>Every modern browser comes with a suite of developer tools that allow you to inspect and manipulate websites in real-time. These tools are typically hidden from regular users but are invaluable to developers. Today, we'll explore these tools in depth, focusing primarily on Chrome DevTools, although similar functionality exists in Firefox, Safari, and Edge.</p>
            
            <p>The knowledge you gain today will help you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Debug HTML, CSS, and JavaScript issues more efficiently</li>
                <li>Understand how browsers render content</li>
                <li>Optimize website performance</li>
                <li>Test responsive designs across various device sizes</li>
                <li>Monitor network activity and troubleshoot connectivity issues</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Accessing Developer Tools</h2>
            <p>Before diving in, let's make sure we all know how to access these tools:</p>
            
            <div class="keyboard-shortcuts">
                <h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Windows/Linux:</strong> F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I</li>
                    <li><strong>macOS:</strong> Cmd+Option+I</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="browser-menus">
                <h3>Browser Menus</h3>

            <h2>Elements Panel: Your Digital Surgeon's Table</h2>
            
            <p>The Elements panel is like a surgeon's operating table for web pages. It displays the complete HTML structure of the page and allows you to perform "live operations" on the DOM (Document Object Model). Think of the DOM as the skeleton and organs of a webpage - here you can examine each bone, muscle, and nerve of your page's structure.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>DOM Tree Navigation</h4>
                <p>The DOM tree is displayed as an expandable and collapsible tree structure. This hierarchical representation helps you understand the parent-child relationships between elements - much like a family tree for your website.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> When debugging layout issues, you can easily identify if elements are nested incorrectly or if extra wrapper elements are causing spacing problems.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>Live Editing</h4>
                <p>You can edit HTML elements directly in the panel to see immediate changes. This is like being able to swap out parts of a car engine while it's still running - you get immediate feedback on how your changes affect the page.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> When collaborating with designers, you can quickly test different text content, attributes, or even entire elements to see what works best before changing your actual code.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Double-click on any text to change it, or right-click an element and select "Edit as HTML" to modify the entire element including its attributes.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>CSS Inspection and Editing</h4>
                <p>The Styles pane shows all CSS rules applying to the selected element. You can toggle properties on/off, change values, and add new properties.</p>
                <p>The CSS cascade is presented with the most specific rules at the top, making it easy to understand why certain styles are being applied or overridden (specificity conflicts).</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> When dealing with complex CSS inheritance, you can see exactly which stylesheets and rules are affecting an element, helping resolve conflicts and unexpected styling.</p>
                <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Notice the strikethrough text on CSS properties that are being overridden by more specific rules. This visual cue helps you understand the cascade at a glance.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>Box Model Visualization</h4>
                <p>The Computed tab shows the final computed styles for the selected element, including a visual representation of the box model (content, padding, border, margin).</p>
                <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> The box model visualization is like an architectural blueprint that shows all the measurements and spacing of your element - the content area (the living room), padding (hallways), border (walls), and margin (yard space between buildings).</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> When debugging layout issues, the box model visualization helps you identify exactly where extra space is coming from.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>Element State Simulation</h4>
                <p>You can force element states like :hover, :active, :focus, and :visited without having to actually interact with the element.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> This is particularly useful for testing interactive elements like buttons and form fields in different states without having to repeatedly hover or click.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> To test a hover effect on a button that's hard to keep your mouse over, simply select the element in the Elements panel, then click the ":hov" button and check the :hover option.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="hands-on">
                <h4>Hands-on Exercise</h4>
                <p>Let's practice using the Elements panel:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open any website (our course page works great for this)</li>
                    <li>Right-click on a button or link and select "Inspect"</li>
                    <li>Try editing the text content</li>
                    <li>In the Styles pane, try changing the background-color</li>
                    <li>Add a new CSS property like transform: rotate(5deg);</li>
                    <li>Examine the box model to understand the element's spacing</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </section>
        
        <section class="console">
            <h2>Console Panel: Your Communication Line with JavaScript</h2>
            
            <p>The Console panel serves as your direct communication channel with the JavaScript environment of the page. Think of it as both a walkie-talkie to communicate with your code and a black box recorder that logs all important events and errors.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>Error Reporting</h4>
                <p>The console automatically displays JavaScript errors with file names, line numbers, and stack traces.</p>
                <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like having a spelling and grammar checker that not only points out mistakes but also tells you exactly which book, page, and paragraph contains the error.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> When a feature isn't working as expected, checking the console for errors is often the fastest way to identify the issue.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>Interactive JavaScript Execution</h4>
                <p>You can execute JavaScript commands directly in the console, interacting with the page's variables, functions, and objects.</p>
                <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like having a universal remote control that can operate any part of your website's functionality on demand.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> You can test JavaScript functions without modifying your code, inspect variables to verify their values, or manipulate the DOM directly.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <pre><code>// Get all paragraphs on the page
const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll('p');

// Show how many paragraphs exist
console.log(`This page has ${paragraphs.length} paragraphs.`);

// Change the text color of all paragraphs
paragraphs.forEach(p => p.style.color = 'blue');</code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>Console API Methods</h4>
                <p>Beyond the basic console.log(), the Console API offers various methods for better debugging:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>console.log()</code> - General output</li>
                    <li><code>console.error()</code> - Error messages (red with error icon)</li>
                    <li><code>console.warn()</code> - Warning messages (yellow with warning icon)</li>
                    <li><code>console.info()</code> - Informational messages (with info icon)</li>
                    <li><code>console.table()</code> - Display objects or arrays in tabular format</li>
                    <li><code>console.group()</code> and <code>console.groupEnd()</code> - Group related messages</li>
                    <li><code>console.time()</code> and <code>console.timeEnd()</code> - Measure execution time</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> Using these specialized methods makes your debugging more organized and visually distinctive, especially when working with complex applications that generate many console messages.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <pre><code>// Timing how long an operation takes
console.time('dataProcessing');
const result = processLargeDataSet(data);
console.timeEnd('dataProcessing'); // Outputs: dataProcessing: 1234.56ms

// Displaying complex data in a table
const users = [
  { name: 'Alice', role: 'Admin', active: true },
  { name: 'Bob', role: 'User', active: false },
  { name: 'Charlie', role: 'User', active: true }
];
console.table(users);</code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>Accessing DOM Elements with Selector Syntax</h4>
                <p>The console provides shorthand functions for DOM selection:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>$(selector)</code> - Equivalent to document.querySelector()</li>
                    <li><code>$$(selector)</code> - Equivalent to document.querySelectorAll()</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> These shortcuts make it much faster to test selectors and manipulate elements during debugging sessions.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <pre><code>// Get the first button
const button = $('button');

// Get all links and turn them red
$$('a').forEach(link => link.style.color = 'red');</code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <div class="hands-on">
                <h4>Hands-on Exercise</h4>
                <p>Let's practice using the Console panel:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open the developer tools and navigate to the Console panel</li>
                    <li>Try the following commands:
                        <pre><code>// Count elements
console.log('This page has ' + $$('img').length + ' images');

// Check a specific element's properties
$('h1').textContent;

// Try a more complex example
console.table(
  Array.from($$('a')).map(link => ({
    text: link.textContent.slice(0, 30),
    href: link.href,
    target: link.target
  }))
);</code></pre>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

        <section class="network">
            <h2>Network Panel: Your Web Traffic Monitor</h2>
            
            <p>The Network panel allows you to monitor all network requests that your browser makes when loading and interacting with a website. Think of it as a security camera system for your web traffic - it records and analyzes every file, API call, and resource that enters or leaves your application.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>Request Monitoring</h4>
                <p>Every HTTP request is logged with detailed information including URL, method (GET, POST, etc.), status code, size, and timing.</p>
                <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like having an itemized receipt for everything your website "purchases" from servers across the internet - you can see exactly what was requested, how much it cost (in terms of bytes and time), and whether the transaction was successful.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> When a website is loading slowly, the Network panel helps identify which resources are taking the longest to load or if there are failing requests causing bottlenecks.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>Filtering and Sorting</h4>
                <p>You can filter requests by type (JS, CSS, images, XHR, etc.) or search for specific files.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> When debugging API calls, you can filter to show only XHR/fetch requests to focus on data exchanges without the noise of other resource loading.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>Timeline View</h4>
                <p>The waterfall chart shows when each request started and how long it took, visualizing the loading sequence.</p>
                <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like a race track where each request is a runner - you can see who started first, who finished last, and which runners (resources) are slowing down the entire race.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> Identifying render-blocking resources that delay the page's initial display, or spotting opportunities for parallel downloads.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>Request Details</h4>
                <p>Clicking on any request reveals tabs with detailed information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Headers:</strong> HTTP headers sent and received</li>
                    <li><strong>Preview:</strong> Formatted view of the response content</li>
                    <li><strong>Response:</strong> Raw response data</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Breakdown of the request timeline</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like being able to open a package that arrived at your door and inspect not just its contents, but also the shipping label, packaging, handling instructions, and exactly how long it spent at each facility along its journey.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> When debugging API responses, you can examine exactly what data came back from the server and if necessary HTTP headers like authorization tokens or content types are correctly set.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>Network Throttling</h4>
                <p>You can simulate slower network connections (3G, 2G, etc.) to test how your site performs under different conditions.</p>
                <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> This is like being able to test drive your car on different road surfaces - highway, city streets, gravel roads - to see how it performs in various conditions.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> Ensuring your website provides a good experience for users with slower internet connections, which is especially important for global audiences.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>Export/Import</h4>
                <p>You can save network activity logs for later analysis or sharing with team members.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> This is invaluable when collaborating on complex issues or documenting problems that only occur in specific environments.</p>

                    <li>Open a new browser tab and open the Developer Tools</li>
                    <li>Go to the Network panel and make sure recording is enabled (the red circle should be solid)</li>
                    <li>Navigate to a website of your choice</li>
                    <li>Observe the waterfall chart as resources load</li>
                    <li>Filter to show only image requests</li>
                    <li>Click on one image request and examine its headers and response</li>
                    <li>Try changing the network throttling to "Slow 3G" and reload the page</li>
                    <li>Notice how loading patterns change under constrained conditions</li>

            <h2>Sources Panel: Your Code Debugging Headquarters</h2>
            
            <p>The Sources panel is your dedicated debugging environment for JavaScript. Think of it as a detective's investigation room, where you can examine clues, set up surveillance, and follow the trail of execution to solve the mystery of buggy code.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>File Navigator</h4>
                <p>Browse all JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files loaded by the page, including those from other domains.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> When working with complex applications that load numerous script files, this provides a clear overview of the codebase structure.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>Code Editor</h4>
                <p>View and edit source files with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and formatting.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> You can make temporary changes to scripts directly in the browser to test fixes before implementing them in your actual codebase.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="feature">
                <h4>Breakpoints</h4>
                <p>Set points in your code where execution will pause, allowing you to inspect the state of variables and the call stack.</p>
                <p><strong>Analogy:</strong> Breakpoints are like pressing pause on a movie at crucial scenes to examine all the details of what's happening in that exact moment.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world application:</strong> When a function isn't producing expected results, you can set breakpoints to examine its inputs, internal state, and outputs during execution.</p>
                <p><strong>Types of breakpoints:</strong></p>

            <h2>Effective Developer Tools Workflow</h2>
            
            <p>Now that we've explored the individual panels, let's discuss how to integrate them into an effective development workflow.</p>
            
            <div class="workflow-scenario">
                <h3>Scenario 1: Debugging a JavaScript Error</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Check the Console panel for error messages</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to the Sources panel and locate the file mentioned in the error</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Set a breakpoint at the reported line number or slightly before it</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Reload the page or reproduce the action that causes the error</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> When execution pauses, inspect variables and the call stack</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Use step controls to follow the execution path</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Fix the issue in your source code or use Workspaces to edit directly in DevTools</li>
                </ol>

            <div class="workflow-scenario">
                <h3>Scenario 2: Optimizing Page Load Performance</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use the Network panel to identify slow-loading resources</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Apply network throttling to simulate slower connections</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Use the Performance panel to record a page load</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Analyze the recording to find long tasks or rendering bottlenecks</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Check the Summary view to identify which category (loading, scripting, rendering, painting) is taking the most time</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Focus optimization efforts on the identified bottlenecks</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Scenario 3: Fixing a Layout Issue</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use Device Mode to identify at which screen sizes the issue appears</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Inspect the problematic element using the Elements panel</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Check the applied CSS rules and the box model</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Experiment with turning rules on/off or modifying values</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you've found a solution, apply it to your source CSS</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Test across multiple device sizes to ensure the fix works everywhere</li>

                <h3>Scenario 4: Troubleshooting API Integration</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use the Network panel with XHR/fetch filtering enabled</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Trigger the API call by interacting with the page</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Examine the request headers, payload, and response</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If needed, set XHR breakpoints in the Sources panel to pause execution when the API is called</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Check how the response data is being processed in your JavaScript</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Test different API responses using local overrides or by modifying the JavaScript</li>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Developer tools are not just utilities; they're extensions of your development skills. Just as a carpenter becomes more effective with better tools and the knowledge of how to use them, a web developer becomes more efficient and capable when mastering browser developer tools.</p>
            
            <p>As we progress through this course, you'll find yourself naturally incorporating these tools into your daily workflow. The more you practice with them, the more intuitive they'll become, and you'll discover your own preferred methods for debugging, testing, and optimizing web applications.</p>
            
            <p>Remember, developer tools are constantly evolving. Modern browsers regularly add new features and improvements to their DevTools. Make it a habit to stay updated with the latest developments by occasionally checking the official documentation and blog posts from browser vendors.</p>
            
            <p>In our afternoon session, we'll build on this knowledge and look at some practical examples of using these tools to solve common web development challenges.</p>
