            <h2>Introduction to Web Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Imagine arriving at a building with no ramps, only stairs, and doors too narrow for wheelchairs. For people with mobility impairments, this physical barrier prevents them from accessing the building. Web accessibility is about ensuring that similar barriers don't exist in the digital world, making websites and applications usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or the methods they use to interact with digital content.</p>
            
            <p>Accessibility (often abbreviated as "a11y" - the 11 representing the number of letters between 'a' and 'y') is not just a nice-to-have feature or a legal checkbox to tick. It's a fundamental aspect of web development that acknowledges the diverse ways people experience and interact with digital content. Just as physical spaces should accommodate people with diverse abilities, digital spaces should be designed with the same inclusivity in mind.</p>

            <h2>Why Accessibility Matters</h2>
            
            <p>Accessibility isn't just about accommodating people with permanent disabilities. Consider these scenarios:</p>
            
            <div class="scenarios">
                <ul>
                    <li>A person with a broken arm temporarily using a keyboard instead of a mouse</li>
                    <li>An older adult with declining vision who needs larger text</li>
                    <li>Someone in a noisy environment who can't hear audio content</li>
                    <li>A person using a slow internet connection who benefits from optimized page loads</li>
                    <li>Someone with cognitive disabilities who needs clear, consistent navigation</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>When we design for accessibility, we're designing for all these situations and more. The improvements we make benefit everyone, not just users with disabilities.</p>
            
            <div class="motivation">
                <h3>Three Key Motivations for Accessibility</h3>
                
                <div class="ethical">
                    <h4>Ethical Considerations</h4>
                    <p>The web was designed as a universal platform, available to all regardless of hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When we build inaccessible websites, we're contradicting this foundational principle and potentially excluding millions of users. The World Health Organization estimates that over one billion people (about 15% of the world's population) live with some form of disability.</p>
                    <p>Building accessible websites aligns with the principles of digital inclusion and equal opportunity, acknowledging that access to information and services is increasingly a fundamental right in our digital society.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="legal">
                    <h4>Legal Requirements</h4>
                    <p>In many countries, accessibility is mandated by law:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>United States:</strong> The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act apply to many websites</li>
                        <li><strong>European Union:</strong> The European Accessibility Act and various national laws require digital accessibility</li>
                        <li><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> The Equality Act covers website accessibility</li>
                        <li><strong>Canada:</strong> The Accessible Canada Act addresses digital inclusion</li>
                        <li><strong>Australia:</strong> The Disability Discrimination Act applies to web content</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Legal requirements vary by region, but the trend is toward stronger enforcement of digital accessibility. Non-compliance can lead to lawsuits, financial penalties, and damage to reputation.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="business">
                    <h4>Business Benefits</h4>
                    <p>Accessibility is good for business for several reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Expanded Market:</strong> Accessible websites reach more potential customers</li>
                        <li><strong>Improved Brand Perception:</strong> Demonstrates corporate social responsibility</li>
                        <li><strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong> Many accessibility features improve usability for all users</li>
                        <li><strong>Better SEO:</strong> Many accessibility practices align with search engine optimization</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduced Legal Risk:</strong> Proactive accessibility reduces the risk of litigation</li>
                        <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Designing for diverse needs often leads to creative solutions</li>

            <h2>Key Accessibility Standards and Guidelines</h2>
            
            <p>Several organizations have developed standards and guidelines for web accessibility. Understanding these frameworks is essential for creating accessible web content.</p>
            
            <div class="wcag">
                <h3>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</h3>
                <p>WCAG is the most widely recognized standard for web accessibility, developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) through their Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). Currently at version 2.1 (with 2.2 in development), WCAG provides a comprehensive framework for making web content accessible.</p>
                
                <div class="principles">
                    <h4>Four Core Principles of WCAG</h4>
                    <p>WCAG is organized around four principles, often remembered by the acronym "POUR":</p>
                    
                    <div class="principle">
                        <h5>Perceivable</h5>
                        <p>Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. This means providing text alternatives for non-text content, captions for multimedia, creating content that can be presented in different ways, and making it easier for users to see and hear content.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Providing alt text for images so screen reader users can understand the image content.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="principle">
                        <h5>Operable</h5>
                        <p>User interface components and navigation must be operable. This means making all functionality available from a keyboard, giving users enough time to read and use content, not designing content in a way that is known to cause seizures, and providing ways to help users navigate and find content.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Ensuring all interactive elements can be accessed and activated using keyboard navigation.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="principle">
                        <h5>Understandable</h5>
                        <p>Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable. This means making text readable and understandable, making content appear and operate in predictable ways, and helping users avoid and correct mistakes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Using clear labels for form fields and providing helpful error messages when users make mistakes.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="principle">
                        <h5>Robust</h5>
                        <p>Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. This means maximizing compatibility with current and future user tools.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Writing valid HTML that properly uses semantic elements and ARIA attributes when needed.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="conformance">
                    <h4>WCAG Conformance Levels</h4>
                    <p>WCAG defines three levels of conformance:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Level A:</strong> The most basic web accessibility features</li>
                        <li><strong>Level AA:</strong> Addresses the biggest and most common barriers for disabled users (this is the level most organizations aim for and is often referenced in laws and policies)</li>
                        <li><strong>Level AAA:</strong> The highest level of accessibility</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="aria">
                <h3>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)</h3>
                <p>WAI-ARIA is a set of attributes that define ways to make web content and applications more accessible. These attributes supplement HTML to provide additional semantics about the roles, states, and properties of user interface elements.</p>
                
                <p>ARIA is particularly useful for dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with JavaScript and HTML. It helps bridge the gaps in HTML's native accessibility features, especially for complex interactive components.</p>
                
                <div class="aria-categories">
                    <h4>ARIA Categories</h4>
                    
                    <div class="category">
                        <h5>Roles</h5>
                        <p>Define what an element is or does, such as <code>role="navigation"</code>, <code>role="button"</code>, or <code>role="alert"</code>.</p>

                        <h5>States</h5>
                        <p>Define the current condition of an element, such as <code>aria-checked="true"</code>, <code>aria-disabled="true"</code>, or <code>aria-expanded="false"</code>.</p>

                <div class="aria-caution">
                    <h4>A Word of Caution About ARIA</h4>
                    <p>The first rule of ARIA is: <em>Don't use ARIA if you can use a native HTML element with the semantics and behavior you require.</em> ARIA should be used to enhance accessibility, not replace proper HTML semantics.</p>
                    <p>For example, instead of:</p>
                    <pre><code>&lt;div role="button" tabindex="0" onclick="activateButton()"&gt;
  Click Me
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                    <p>It's better to use:</p>
                    <pre><code>&lt;button onclick="activateButton()"&gt;
  Click Me

            <h2>Common Accessibility Barriers and Solutions</h2>
            
            <p>Now that we understand the standards, let's look at common accessibility barriers and how to address them. These practical approaches will help you implement accessibility in your web projects.</p>
            
            <div class="barrier">
                <h3>Visual Barriers</h3>
                <p>Users with visual impairments, including blindness, low vision, and color blindness, may face several challenges:</p>
                
                <div class="solution">
                    <h4>Images Without Alt Text</h4>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Screen readers cannot interpret images without text alternatives.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always provide descriptive alt text for images that convey information.</p>
                    <pre><code><!-- Bad example -->
&lt;img src="chart-2025-profits.png"&gt;

<!-- Good example -->
&lt;img src="chart-2025-profits.png" alt="Bar chart showing quarterly profits for 2025, with Q3 showing the highest growth at 27%"&gt;

<!-- Decorative image example -->
&lt;img src="decorative-divider.png" alt=""&gt;</code></pre>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Decorative images should have empty alt text (<code>alt=""</code>) so screen readers will skip them, rather than no alt attribute at all.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="solution">
                    <h4>Poor Color Contrast</h4>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Text with insufficient contrast against its background is difficult to read for many users, especially those with low vision or color blindness.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Ensure sufficient color contrast according to WCAG guidelines:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text (Level AA)</li>
                        <li>3:1 for large text (at least 18pt or 14pt bold) (Level AA)</li>
                        <li>7:1 for normal text (Level AAA)</li>
                        <li>4.5:1 for large text (Level AAA)</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="solution">
                    <h4>Relying Solely on Color to Convey Information</h4>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Users with color blindness may miss information if color alone is used to convey it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always use multiple cues beyond color, such as patterns, text, or icons.</p>
                    <pre><code><!-- Bad example -->

                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use relative units for font sizes and ensure the layout accommodates text resizing.</p>
                    <pre><code>/* Problematic fixed font size */

            <h2>Advanced Accessibility with ARIA</h2>
            
            <p>While semantic HTML should be your first choice, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes can enhance accessibility when HTML alone isn't sufficient. Let's explore common ARIA use cases and best practices.</p>
            
            <div class="aria-when-to-use">
                <h3>When to Use ARIA</h3>
                <p>Use ARIA when:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You need to create custom interactive components that don't have native HTML equivalents</li>
                    <li>You're working with dynamic content that updates without page reloads</li>
                    <li>You need to add additional information or relationships not conveyed by HTML semantics</li>
                    <li>You need to support legacy code where completely replacing with semantic HTML isn't feasible</li>
                </ul>
